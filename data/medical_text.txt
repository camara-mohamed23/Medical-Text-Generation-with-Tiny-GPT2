BACKGROUND: Hippocampal sclerosis (HS) is characterized by neuronal loss and 
gliosis in the cornu Ammonis (CA) region of the hippocampus and is associated 
with epilepsy, hypoxia, and neurodegenerative diseases. In dementia, HS is 
increasingly recognized as a potential biomarker for Limbic-predominant 
Age-related TDP-43 Encephalopathy neuropathological change (LATE-NC). However, 
LATE-NC currently lacks a validated in vivo biomarker. Since HS is detectable by 
MRI, a key question is whether HS could serve as a reliable proxy for underlying 
LATE-NC pathology. This study examines the prevalence and pathological 
associations of HS across neurodegenerative diseases in a large population-based 
brain bank to assess its potential as a biomarker for LATE-NC.
METHOD: Data were analyzed from the Biobank for Aging Study (BAS-GEROLAB) in São 
Paulo, Brazil. Clinical and epidemiological information was obtained from next 
of kin using validated protocols, including the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) 
scale. Neuropathological assessments included morphological, vascular, and 
immunohistochemical analyses for beta- amyloid, tau, alpha-synuclein, and 
TDP-43. HS was defined as ≥70% neuronal loss in CA1 (unilateral). Individuals 
with a history of epilepsy were excluded.
RESULT: Among 1,307 individuals, 36.9% were non-White and 49.7% were women. HS 
was identified in 41 participants (3.1%), with higher prevalence among older 
individuals, women, and those with lower education levels (p < 0.001). HS was 
also significantly associated with hyaline arteriolosclerosis (p = 0.001) and 
diabetes mellitus (p = 0.003) (Table 1). Multivariate analysis confirmed 
associations between HS and LATE-NC (p < 0.001) as well as lacunar infarcts 
(p = 0.031) (Table 2). The positive predictive value (PPV) of HS for TDP- 43 
pathology was 48.8%, increasing to 59.4% among cognitively impaired individuals 
(n = 432) (Table 3). Among individuals with HS but no TDP-43 pathology (n = 21), 
48.4% had Braak-AD stage ≥3, and 64.5% exhibited arteriolosclerosis.
CONCLUSION: HS is relatively uncommon in this population-based brain bank but is 
strongly associated with TDP-43 pathology. However, vascular pathology also 
plays a significant role, particularly in populations with high cardiovascular 
risk. This limits its predictive value for LATE-NC, even among cognitively 
impaired individuals. Given the absence of an in vivo biomarker for LATE-NC, 
further research is needed to determine whether MRI-detectable HS can serve as a 
reliable surrogate marker for LATE-NC pathology, particularly in genetically 
diverse populations with multiple comorbidities.

BACKGROUND: Paediatric and young adult differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) 
often presents at an advanced stage but carries an excellent prognosis. While 
age-related genomic differences from adult DTC are recognized, it remains 
unclear whether outcomes are driven by age or tumour biology.
METHODS: We analysed a multi-institutional cohort of 363 patients aged 0-25 
years who underwent molecular testing and surgical management. Age was 
categorized using cutoffs at ≤8, 9-14, 15-18, and 19-25 years). The primary 
endpoint was disease status at last follow-up, categorized according to American 
Thyroid Association (ATA) response criteria. Multivariable ordered logistic 
regression was used to test the independent prognostic effect of somatic driver 
mutations while adjusting for age, sex, and follow-up duration.
RESULTS: Distinct age-related patterns of oncogenic drivers were observed: RET 
and NTRK1/3 fusions were predominant in younger patients, BRAF V600E was most 
frequent in adolescents, and RAS mutations were enriched in young adults. After 
adjustment, driver mutations independently predicted long-term outcomes. NTRK1/3 
fusions (aOR 5.29, 95% CI 1.77-15.79), BRAF V600E (aOR 3.45, 95% CI 1.37-8.70), 
and RET fusions (aOR 3.34, 95% CI 1.13-9.90) were associated with significantly 
higher odds of a non-excellent outcome. Conversely, RAS mutations showed a 
favourable trend, and all DICER1-mutant cases achieved excellent outcomes. While 
prognosis steadily improved with age, mutation status remained the dominant 
factor determining outcomes.
CONCLUSION: Somatic drivers offer prognostic insights independent of age in 
paediatric and young adult DTC, establishing a molecular framework for precision 
risk stratification that complements traditional clinical staging and age-based 
assessments.

A 38-yr-old primigravida presented at 30 + 2 wk' gestation with 
pregnancy-induced hypertension and was found to have severe hypercalcaemia 
(adjusted calcium 3.19 mmol/L). Intravenous fluid therapy produced only 
transient improvement, and recurrent hypercalcaemia required repeated inpatient 
management. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) was suppressed, while both 25(OH)D₃ and 
1,25(OH)₂D₃ (calcitriol) were elevated. Imaging and laboratory investigations 
revealed no evidence of malignancy or granulomatous disease. Delivery by 
elective caesarean section was undertaken at 35 wk' gestation. The neonate 
developed transient hypocalcaemia with suppressed PTH, requiring brief 
intravenous calcium supplementation. Maternal hypercalcaemia persisted 
postpartum, and renal imaging revealed nephrolithiasis and nephrocalcinosis. 
Serum calcium remained elevated during lactation but normalized after weaning. 
Extended vitamin D metabolite profiling showed an increased 
25(OH)D₃:24,25(OH)₂D₃ ratio, and genetic analysis confirmed compound 
heterozygous pathogenic variants in CYP24A1, encoding vitamin D 24-hydroxylase, 
the enzyme responsible for calcitriol degradation. The findings established a 
diagnosis of gestational hypercalcaemia due to CYP24A1 deficiency. Normal 
pregnancy is associated with physiological rises in calcitriol, reduced PTH, and 
hypercalciuria, features that can mimic or mask this disorder. This case 
illustrates the diagnostic challenges of recognizing CYP24A1 deficiency in 
pregnancy.

BACKGROUND: Comparative assessment of therapeutic technologies is often biased 
due to the inability to blind interventions, especially when therapies differ in 
form or dosing. While double-dummy design, where participants receive both an 
active treatment and a matched placebo to maintain blinding, is well established 
in pharmacological trials, its applicability for medical devices requiring user 
interaction, such as automated insulin delivery (AID) systems is challenging.
METHODS: We present the methodology by which two AID systems are used in a 
double-dummy, blinded, randomized trial, one system providing insulin therapy 
and the other, a diluent.Outcomes and conclusion:The study demonstrates the 
feasibility, of comparing 2 AID systems, without operartor bias.

INTRODUCTION: Obesity represents a significant public health problem, 
particularly due to its strong association with additional cardiovascular risk 
factors, such as hypertension, insulin resistance (IR), type 2 diabetes 
mellitus, metabolic syndrome (MS) and cardiovascular disease. IR is the 
underlying factor of the relationship between obesity and metabolic 
dysregulation. The identification of IR is crucial for early diagnosis, clinical 
management and specific treatment.
AIM: This study aims to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of the 
Triglycerides/Glucose (TyG) Index in identifying IR and target-organ damage in a 
cohort of patients with essential hypertension.
METHODS: we have evaluated 235 consecutive patients with essential hypertension 
(50.1% men and 49.9% women; mean age 51.9 ± 17.3 years), stratified for body 
mass index (BMI). Biochemical analysis and instrumental evaluation were assessed 
to identify target-organ damage.
RESULTS: Increased BMI was associated with higher values of blood pressure, 
glycaemia and triglycerides. In patients with higher BMI, we observed more 
prevalent target-organ damage, particularly cardiac remodeling (78.3%) and 
higher 24-h urinary albumin excretion (83.7±48 mg/L). The TyG index proved to be 
a stronger biomarker for identifying the development of MS (AUC 0.78) and 
cardiac remodeling (AUC 0.66).
CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that obesity is correlated with a impaired 
hemodynamic and metabolic profile. The TyG index could represent an efficient 
and easy-to-use indicator for identifying both individuals developing MS and 
early cardiac remodeling, especially in normal-weight subjects.

BACKGROUND: Plasma ceramides are recognized biomarkers of cardiovascular risk; 
however, racial and ethnic differences in their levels, as well as their 
association with cardiovascular health (CVH) among African-American populations, 
remain insufficiently studied.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess the association between ceramide scores 
and CVH, as well as atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk, among 
African-American adults, and to compare ceramide scores between African-American 
and White adults.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a secondary analysis of 2 U.S. studies 
including African-American and White adults. Collected data encompassed 
demographics, behavioral factors (e.g., diet) and clinical measures (e.g., 
plasma ceramide levels). Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk was 
assessed using the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association 
(ACC/AHA) 10-year pooled cohort equations, while CVH was evaluated using the 
American Heart Association (AHA) Life's Essential 8 (LE8) scoring system.
RESULTS: Fifty-eight African-American adults (mean age: 54.6 years; 67.2% women) 
and 1,103 White adults (mean age: 64.5 years; 52.1% women) were included. 
Compared with White participants, African-Americans had significantly higher 
prevalence of obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia, but similar 
ASCVD risk (12.8% vs 12.6%; p = 0.65). No significant associations were observed 
between ceramide scores and either LE8 or ASCVD risk in African-Americans. 
Ceramide levels differed by race/ethnicity, with African-Americans showing lower 
concentrations of 18:0 (0.08 vs 0.10 μmol/L) and 24:1 (0.91 vs 1.17 μmol/L) 
species compared with White adults (both p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: No association was observed between ceramide scores and CVH or ASCVD 
risk in African-American adults. Despite having a less favorable cardiometabolic 
profile, African-Americans exhibited lower ceramide levels than White adults. 
These findings suggest that ceramide scores may not accurately reflect 
cardiovascular risk in African-American populations.

BACKGROUND: Fasting, practiced in clinical, cultural, and faith-based contexts, 
has emerged as a non-pharmacological strategy capable of modulating multiple 
physiological systems. Contemporary evidence suggests that diverse fasting 
patterns (intermittent and time-restricted fasting, Ramadan fasting, 
alternate-day and periodic fasting, dry fasting, and fasting-mimicking diets) 
converge on shared metabolic-circadian-immune pathways and can be conceptualized 
within an integrated resilience framework.
AIM: This narrative review synthesizes current experimental and human data on 
fasting as a multisystem health modulator, linking metabolic, cardiovascular, 
immune, gut-liver-microbiome, neurocognitive, endocrine, and psychospiritual 
effects to common regulatory axes, particularly the Metabolic-Circadian-Immune 
(MCI) and Energy-Information-Resilience (EIR) models.
RESULTS: Across fasting modalities, activation of energy-sensing pathways 
(AMPK-SIRT1-mTOR), metabolic switching to lipolysis and ketogenesis, enhanced 
autophagy/mitophagy, and improved insulin sensitivity have been shown to support 
the management of obesity, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and 
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Fasting also modulates immune and 
inflammatory tone, reshapes the gut microbiome, and may benefit autoimmune 
conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis. Cardiovascular, 
endocrine, and neurocognitive domains show improvements in blood pressure, lipid 
profiles, neurotrophic signaling, mood, and cognitive resilience, while 
structured religious fasting (e.g., Ramadan) can additionally reinforce 
psychological discipline and spiritual well-being. At the same time, responses 
are heterogeneous, and prolonged or intensive regimens may pose risks in 
vulnerable populations.
CONCLUSION: Fasting can be viewed as a low-cost, multidimensional 
"biopsychospiritual" health intervention acting through interconnected 
metabolic, circadian, immune, and neurobehavioral pathways. By integrating 
traditional and religious fasting practices with contemporary mechanistic and 
clinical data, this review highlights shared energy- and immune-regulatory axes 
and underscores the potential of fasting within integrative, preventive, and 
personalized care. Standardized protocols, long-term outcomes, and multimodal 
trials combining immunophenotyping, microbiome/metabolomic profiling, and 
neuroimaging remain priorities for future research.

We conducted a systematic search of the literature in PubMed, EMBASE and the 
Cochrane Library until February 27, 2024. We also performed a manual search, 
including screening reference lists of previous systematic reviews and 
meta-analyses, to retrieve additional relevant articles for analysis. A random 
effects model was used to estimate pooled effects. On the basis of sample size, 
the P value of the Egger test, and interstudy heterogeneity, observational study 
evidence was classified as high quality (class I), medium quality (class II or 
III), or low quality (class IV). Sensitivity analyses also assessed the 
susceptibility of the findings of this meta-analysis. Of the 2,200 articles 
screened, 38 unique cohort studies comprising 3,736 patients were included in 
the data synthesis. Studies with high-quality evidence showed that male patients 
(OR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.00 ~ 1.70) were at greater risk for cage subsidence. 
Studies with moderate-quality evidence suggested that patients with TMC without 
end-caps (OR 2.77; 95% CI, 1.25 ~ 6.16) were at greater risk for cage 
subsidence. Studies with low-quality evidence revealed that two-level surgery 
(OR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.05 ~ 2.82), three-level surgery (OR, 1.96; 95% CI, 
1.01 ~ 3.79), and multiple-level surgery (OR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.17 ~ 2.85) were 
high risk factors for cage subsidence after cervical fusion. The meta-analysis 
revealed no associations between tobacco use, diabetes, cage type, or specific 
segment of surgery and cage subsidence. Our meta-analysis revealed significant 
risk factors for cage subsidence, including 1 patient-related risk factor (male) 
and 4 surgery-related risk factors (including TMC without end-caps and 
two-level, three-level, and multi-level surgeries). However, these findings must 
be interpreted with caution, as most risk factors in the study population were 
rare. Nevertheless, the findings may help clinicians identify high-risk patients 
to improve outcomes.

AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: MicroRNAs are potential predictors and mediators of metabolic 
disease. Cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD) is the most common comorbidity 
in cystic fibrosis (CF). Here we aimed to investigate serum microRNAs in 
individuals with CF and differing glucose tolerance status. Specifically, we 
hypothesised that the circulating microRNA profile varies depending on glucose 
tolerance status and can change rapidly in response to a glucose challenge in 
individuals with CF.
METHODS: We studied a cohort of 93 adult Danish participants with CF from four 
glucose tolerance categories: normal glucose tolerance, indeterminate glucose 
tolerance, impaired glucose tolerance and CFRD. In a cross-sectional design we 
sampled during an OGTT at baseline, 10 min, 30 min, 60 min and 180 min. A total 
serum microRNA sequencing was performed using baseline and 60 min samples from 
12 selected individuals, three from each category. We identified 16 candidate 
microRNAs, and these were further investigated in the full cohort at all OGTT 
timepoints using a locked nucleic acid reverse transcription quantitative PCR 
assay. Three microRNAs were selected for in-depth assessment including impact on 
insulin secretion.
RESULTS: We identified four microRNAs differentially expressed at baseline 
(miR-34a-5p, miR-122-5p, miR-885-3 and miR-885-5p) and 12 with differential 
expression changes in response to glucose ingestion. Locked nucleic acid reverse 
transcription quantitative PCR assay validated the results of eight of these 
microRNAs and miR-34a-5p, miR-122-5p and miR-223-3p were selected for in-depth 
assessment. MiR-34a-5p and miR-122-5p were elevated at baseline in indeterminate 
glucose tolerance and CFRD and were associated with elevated liver damage 
markers. MiR-223-3p was differentially expressed during the OGTT, with different 
patterns depending on glucose tolerance state. Glucose-stimulated insulin 
secretion was increased after overexpression of miR-122-5p or miR-223-3p and 
cell viability was decreased after overexpression of miR-34a-5p in 
insulin-secreting cells.
CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: MiR-34a-5p and miR-122-5p show potential as 
biomarkers for CFRD development and liver damage. MiR-122-5p and miR-223-3p 
could mitigate CFRD development by increasing the secretory capacity of the beta 
cells while miR-34a-5p might propagate CFRD development by reducing cell 
viability. We propose that circulating microRNAs can serve as biomarkers for CF 
complications. We further advocate that circulating microRNAs can play a part in 
the intricate crosstalk between metabolic organs and the endocrine pancreas in 
health and disease.

A hormonal disorder that severely affects women's routine physical and emotional 
life is PCOS (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome). It has been witnessed as a heavily 
detrimental and most threatening disorder, causing multiple complications, such 
as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and endometrial carcinoma. One of 
the major causes of PCOS is hyperandrogenism, which results in the dysfunction 
of the ovaries. The enzyme responsible for such excessive production of androgen 
is 3-beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-1 (3βHSD1), which is an oxidoreductase 
that performs multiple functions in steroid metabolism. Trilostane and 
troglitazone are proposed inhibitors for 3βHSD1 with anticipated side effects. 
With the aim to identify non-steroidal phytocompounds, structure-based ligand 
screening against ChEBI was done, which resulted in 3459 compounds. Initially, 
NAD was docked into the protein to have an active enzyme structure. Then other 
ligands were docked. Based on a docking score of - 8.0 kcal/mol, ADME 
properties, and interaction profiling, seven compounds-Aphidicolin, Sagequinone 
methide A, Premarrubiin, Hoda acetal, Ophiopogonanone A, Brosimacutin C, and 
Cremastranone-were listed out. All these seven compounds were reported with 
medicinal importance in the literature. Hence, the stability of protein-ligand 
complexes was analyzed in detail through 200 ns MD simulation. Results from this 
study establish these compounds as leads for drug development to combat PCOS.

INTRODUCTION: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) presents a major challenge in low- 
and middle-income countries (LMICs) due to workforce shortages, limited 
primary-care capacity, and fragmented chronic-care delivery. Community-based 
diabetes care models have emerged as scalable approaches to strengthen 
self-management and extend service reach. With this background, we aimed to 
synthesize global evidence on community-based diabetes care models, classify 
major intervention typologies, examine their alignment with the diabetes care 
continuum, and assess their effectiveness and implementation characteristics.
METHODS: A narrative review was conducted using a structured search of PubMed, 
Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase for studies published between January 2010 
and March 2025. Eligible studies focused on community-based T2DM interventions 
delivered by community health workers (CHWs), peer educators, or 
digital-community hybrids. Interventions were categorized and mapped across the 
diabetes care continuum, and evaluated using the RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, 
Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance) framework, as well as complementary 
integration models.
RESULTS: Eleven studies were included, in which peer-led models were common in 
high-income countries, while CHW-led and hybrid models were predominant in 
LMICs. Interventions demonstrated clinically significant improvements in 
glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), BMI, and self-efficacy. Successful models embedded 
within existing public health systems or culturally rooted community platforms 
showed higher adoption and long-term maintenance. Digital interventions enhanced 
reach, but faced challenges with sustained engagement and infrastructure 
support. The RE-AIM analysis revealed strong effectiveness and reach; however, 
long-term maintenance and adoption varied based on the level of contextual 
integration and supervision structures.
CONCLUSION: Community-based T2DM care models offer scalable, sustainable 
strategies to improve disease control. Integration into national health 
platforms, supportive supervision, and digital augmentation enhance 
implementation success. Challenges persist in follow-up, cost-effectiveness, and 
equity design; scale-up should prioritize integration, financing, and CHW 
capacity.

INTRODUCTION: Efsubaglutide alfa is a novel, long-acting GLP-1RA, which imparts 
human homology, molecular flexibility and enhanced GLP-1 receptor-specific 
binding. This drug-free, observational follow-up evaluated remission and 
durability of glycemic control in drug-naïve T2D participants who had completed 
52 weeks of once-weekly efsubaglutide alfa in the SUPER-1 randomized trial.
METHODS: Adults who completed SUPER-1 with HbA1c ≤ 7.0% discontinued all 
glucose-lowering therapy and entered a 52-week, medication-free observation. The 
primary endpoint was diabetes remission, defined as HbA1c < 6.5% (American 
Diabetes Association criteria, ADA 2021) measured ≥ 3 months after the last 
efsubaglutide dose. Kaplan-Meier (KM) analysis was employed to estimate the 
probability of maintaining HbA1c < 7% over 12 months post-treatment. Continuous 
glucose monitoring (CGM) assessed changes in time in range (TIR). Factors 
contributing to diabetes remission were analyzed using logistic regression and 
subgroup KM analyses.
RESULTS: Twenty-nine participants were enrolled; at 3 months 
post-discontinuation, the diabetes remission rate was 60% (12/20). The 
probabilities of maintaining HbA1c < 7% at 6- and 12-month post-treatment were 
58.1% (17/29; 95% CI 39.0-73.1%) and 41.4% (12/29; 95% CI 24.0-58.0%), 
respectively. Efsubaglutide alfa treatment during the 52-week period 
significantly improved TIR (baseline: 46.4%; 52 week: 89.1%, p < 0.001). TIR 
levels off therapy were 70.1% at 3 months, 68.1% at 6 months and 64.1% at 
12 months. Patients who achieved remission had relatively lower baseline HbA1c 
and higher body mass index (BMI) values before treatment, demonstrating 
significantly greater reductions in waist circumference (- 3.3 cm) and 
postprandial glucose (PPG) levels compared to those who did not remit. 
Post-treatment HbA1c levels and improvements in homeostasis model assessment of 
β-cell (HOMA-β) scores were strongly associated with a higher probability of 
remission (p = 0.03 and 0.05, respectively). Body weight remained stable 
throughout the 12-month drug-free observation without rebound.
CONCLUSIONS: Efsubaglutide alfa demonstrated efficacy in achieving stable 
glycemic control and drug-free diabetes remission. Enhanced β-cell function 
emerged as a key factor contributing to long-term remission.

Neonatal diabetes mellitus (NDM) typically presents within the first 6 months of 
life and generally lacks islet autoantibodies. Genetic elucidation of NDM is a 
prime example of precision medicine in diabetes. However, no published genetic 
data exist for NDM in Thailand. We aimed to assess the genetic etiology of Thai 
NDM using whole exome sequencing (WES). We enrolled 14 Thai patients with NDM 
and measured GAD65, IA-2, and ZnT8 autoantibodies. We then performed WES and 
analyzed 43 NDM-related genes to identify causative variants. All subjects 
tested negative for the three islet autoantibodies. Eight harbored variants in 
well-established NDM genes (KCNJ11 [n = 5], ABCC8 [n = 1], INS [n = 2 in 
identical twins]). Two patients with KCNJ11 variants (rs80356616: p.Val59Met and 
rs8035661: p.Arg50Gln) achieved excellent glycemic control on sulfonylureas, 
illustrating precision therapy. The remaining six carried pathogenic variants in 
genes associated with monogenic diabetes, including LRBA, EIF2AK3, DOCK8, WFS1, 
GATA6, CISD2/SLC9B1, and COQ2. This is the first report on the genetic etiology 
of NDM in Thailand. WES is an effective approach to identifying variants in this 
rare diabetes subtype. Larger cohort studies are needed to determine the true 
prevalence of NDM in Thailand.

PURPOSE: To study telangiectatic capillaries (TelCaps) in the context of 
diabetic macular edema (DME) and the response to injection therapy.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 25 eyes with center involving DME that had 
TelCaps diagnosed on infrared reflectance (IR) and optical coherence tomography 
(OCT) B-scans with at least one year of follow-up. The size of the TelCaps was 
assessed on OCT IR and B-scans. The main outcome measures were the change in 
visual acuity (VA), central subfield thickness (CST), OCT biomarkers of DME, and 
size and number of TelCaps.
RESULTS: Compared to baseline, at 1 year and final follow-up (mean 44 months), 
the mean logMAR VA changed from 0.23 to 0.26 and 0.34, respectively (p = 0.296 
and 0.139), and the mean CST changed from 325 μm to 348 μm and 355 μm, 
respectively (p = 0.172 and 0.098). 72% of the eyes had unchanged or worse VA 
and 64% had increased CST on final follow-up. The mean number of TelCaps per eye 
decreased from 1.36 at baseline to 1.12 at 1 year and 0.76 at the final 
follow-up (p = 0.04), with disappearance in 11 eyes (44%), and new TelCaps 
appearing in 3 eyes (12%). The mean size of the TelCaps was also significantly 
reduced at 1-year and final follow-up on both OCT IR images and B-scans.
CONCLUSION: Visualized on OCT B-scans and IR, TelCaps are dynamic structures 
that undergo significant remodeling over time. Eyes with DME and TelCaps treated 
with injection therapy of anti-VEGF or steroids after at least one year 
exhibited persistent DME despite a decrease in number and size of TelCaps. 
TelCaps may serve as a potential biomarker for chronic DME.

BACKGROUND: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a prevalent metabolic 
complication that arises during pregnancy, posing significant health risks for 
both mother and fetus. The placenta is not only affected by GDM but also 
actively contributes to its pathogenesis and maternal-fetal outcomes. This 
complex interaction makes it difficult to fully understand the etiology of GDM 
and its effects on the placenta. In this study, we aimed to clarify the 
pathogenesis of GDM by evaluating the role of inflammation and describing the 
macroscopic and histopathological changes in placentas affected by GDM.
METHODS: This study compared 50 singleton pregnancies complicated by GDM with 50 
normoglycemic pregnancies. All deliveries occurred at term. Placentas were 
examined both macroscopically and microscopically. Immunohistochemical staining 
was performed for the following markers: CD4, CD8, CD68, CD80, CD86, and CD206.
RESULTS: Placental weight and diameter were significantly higher in the GDM 
group compared to the control group (p < 0.001). GDM placentas showed a 
significantly higher frequency of chorangiosis, villous edema, villous 
immaturity, and ischemic changes (p < 0.001). Immunohistochemical analysis 
revealed increased expression of CD4, CD8, CD68, CD80, and CD86, while CD206 
expression was significantly reduced in the GDM group (p < 0.001).
DISCUSSION: These findings support the central role of placental inflammation 
and macrophage polarization shifts in the pathogenesis of GDM. They also 
highlight potential targets for developing new diagnostic biomarkers and 
anti-inflammatory or immunomodulatory therapeutic strategies.

were searched during August 2025. Odds ratios (ORs) and absolute risk for NAION 
values were pooled using random-effects Peto and inverse-variance models. Any 
ocular event was a secondary outcome.
RESULTS: Fifteen longitudinal studies (n = 8 trials; n > 1.5 million patients) 
were included. GLP-1 RA use was associated with higher NAION risk (OR 1.70; 95% 
CI 1.23-2.36), consistent across randomized (2.36; 0.85-6.53) and nonrandomized 
studies (1.64; 1.15-2.35) (P = 0.51, for heterogeneity). Absolute NAION risk in 
the GLP-1 RA group was 0.09%, corresponding to a 0.037% risk difference (number 
needed to harm ∼ 2,700). There was no association with overall ocular events (OR 
0.95; 95% CI 0.86-1.05).
CONCLUSIONS: GLP-1 RA use was associated with a modest increase in NAION risk 
but not overall ocular adverse events. Findings underscore the need for 
long-term postmarketing safety studies and should be interpreted against their 
well-established mortality and cardio-kidney-metabolic benefits.

BACKGROUND: Adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1D) often experience heightened 
levels of diabetes distress and struggle with maintaining effective 
self-management behavior. Resilience-both at the family and individual levels-is 
a crucial psychological capacity for coping with challenges. However, limited 
research has explored how diabetes distress, family resilience, self-resilience, 
and self-management behavior are interrelated in adolescents with T1D.
OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to examine whether family resilience 
and self-resilience mediate the association between diabetes distress and 
self-management behavior in adolescents with T1D.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in a children's hospital in 
China, involving 143 adolescents with T1D (mean age=13.05 y) and their 
caregivers. Participants completed the Diabetes Behavior Rating Scale, Problem 
Areas in Diabetes Scale, Diabetes Strengths and Resilience measure for 
adolescents, and Family Resilience Assessment Scale. Structural equation 
modeling was employed for data analysis.
RESULTS: Diabetes distress was negatively associated with family resilience, 
self-resilience, and self-management behavior. Family resilience, 
self-resilience, and self-management behavior were positively correlated. Both 
family resilience and self-resilience significantly and partially mediated the 
association between diabetes distress and self-management behavior.
DISCUSSION: These findings highlight that family and individual resilience 
partly buffer the adverse effects of diabetes distress on self-management. 
Interventions should support families in recognizing and leveraging their 
strengths, while incorporating resilience-enhancing strategies to promote both 
psychological well-being and self-management in adolescents with T1D.

BACKGROUND: Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) has been associated with 
improved glycemic control in individuals with non-insulin-treated type 2 
diabetes (T2D), but adoption in endocrinology clinics remains limited.
LOCAL PROBLEM: This quality improvement (QI) project aimed to explore the use of 
CGM for non-insulin-treated patients with T2D within an endocrinology clinic in 
Los Angeles County and to evaluate feasibility of its adoption in this practice 
setting.
METHODS: It was a retrospective chart review.
INTERVENTIONS: Eligible patients were adults (≥18 years) with T2D and hemoglobin 
A1c (HbA1c) >7% who had not been treated with insulin. Ten patients met 
inclusion criteria. Descriptive statistics summarized HbA1c and time-in-range 
(TIR) over 6 months. An interrupted time series was also conducted on two 
patients with sufficient longitudinal data to assess HbA1c changes before and 
after CGM use.
RESULTS: After 6 months of initial CGM use, 8 of 9 patients achieved HbA1c 
reductions of ≥0.3%. One patient demonstrated a ≥8% increase in TIR with 
adequate device use. Interrupted time series analyses illustrated individual 
HbA1c trajectories, showing immediate reductions after CGM initiation and 
nonsignificant downward trends over time.
CONCLUSION: This QI project showed that patients with T2D treated with 
noninsulin medications successfully initiated and used CGM. Early improvements 
in HbA1c were observed; however, sustained glycemic outcomes varied depending on 
consistent CGM wear and adherence to follow-up, underscoring the need for 
individualized support. Nurse practitioners can play a key role in promoting 
sustained CGM use through structured diabetes education, integration of CGM data 
into lifestyle counseling, and regular follow-up.

AIM: Children with cerebral palsy (CP) have reduced bone mineral density (BMD) 
and increased risk of fragility fracture. Despite the critical role in skeletal 
development, no studies have examined insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and 
insulin-like growth factor binding protein- 3 (IGFBP-3), and their association 
with BMD in children with CP when adjusted for bone age. This study assesses the 
relationship between IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 and BMD in children with CP while 
accounting for bone age adjustment.
METHODS: Cross-sectional study, 81 children with CP GMFCS I-V, aged 2-17 years 
(55.6% males), underwent clinical examination, DXA scan, blood sampling and bone 
age assessment. Regression analysis assessed associations between IGF-1, IGFBP-3 
and BMD.
RESULTS: Bone age was 0.64 years lower than chronological age (p < 0.05). 
Adjusted for bone age, BMD showed a positive association with IGF-1 (p < 0.05) 
and IGFBP-3 (p < 0.05). BMD z-score negatively associated with CP severity 
(p < 0.05) and CP severity was negatively associated with IGF-1 (p < 0.5) and 
IGFBP-3 (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Children with CP had lower bone age than chronological age. BMD was 
positively associated with IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 adjusted for bone age. These 
findings are useful in growth hormone and osteoporosis treatment, such as 
Zoledronate, in CP.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the association between serum fibrinogen (FIB) and 
clinicopathological features and renal prognosis in type 2 diabetic nephropathy 
(T2DN), and develop a web-based dynamic model to predict renal progression.
METHODS: This paper retrospectively enrolled 173 biopsy-proven T2DN patients and 
stratified them by the optimal FIB cutoff. Renal progression was defined as a 
>50% decline in eGFR, doubling of creatinine, or onset of end-stage renal 
disease (ESRD). Cox regression analysis was used to screen out the independent 
predictors of T2DN progression; a web-based dynamic prediction model was 
established and evaluated using time-dependent receiver operating characteristic 
(Time-ROC) curves, calibration curves, and decision curve analysis (DCA).
RESULTS: Of the 173 patients, 81 (46.82%) experienced the renal endpoint event. 
Multifactorial Cox regression analysis showed that eGFR, hemoglobin, FIB, 
parathyroid hormone, and interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (IFTA) scores 
were independent risk factors for T2DN progression (P < 0.05). Among the three 
models constructed based on these factors, model 3 had the highest areas under 
the curve (AUC) (90.42; 95% CI, 85.80-95.04). The AUC of the risk prediction 
model constructed by the nomogram was 0.846, 0.752, and 0.754 at 1, 3, and 
5 years, showing good discrimination, and the Web-based dynamic nomogram 
demonstrated good calibration.
CONCLUSIONS: FIB is an independent predictor of T2DN progression. A web-based 
dynamic model was developed to predict renal progression risk in T2DN.

BACKGROUND: Depressive symptoms are a modifiable risk factor for dementia, yet 
underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Depression is a heterogeneous condition, 
encompassing a wide range of symptoms, and it may be valuable to identify 
specific symptom patterns that are most associated with an increased risk of 
cognitive impairment and blood-based biomarkers. Here, we investigated the 
associations between Visit 1 depressive symptoms and plasma 
Amyloid-Tau-Neurodegeneration-Inflammation or ATN(I) biomarkers 7-years later in 
a diverse cohort of middle-aged and older Hispanic/Latino individuals, a 
population often underrepresented in dementia research.
METHOD: Participants recruited into the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of 
Latinos (HCHS/SOL; Visit 1 conducted between 2008-2011) and its ancillary study, 
Study of Latinos-Investigation of Neurocognitive Aging (SOL-INCA; Visit 2 
conducted between 2015-2018) were screened for somatic, negative affective, and 
anhedonia symptoms of depression at Visit 1 (Center for Epidemiological 
Studies-Depression Scale, CESD-10). Plasma ATN(I) biomarkers included 
beta-amyloid 42/40 (Aβ42/40 ratio, n = 5,536), phosphorylated tau181 (p-tau181, 
n = 5,713), neurofilament light chain (NfL, n = 5,866), and glial fibrillary 
acidic protein (GFAP, n = 5,686) measured at Visit 2 7-years later (Quanterix 
Simoa HD-X Analyzer). Survey-based generalized linear regressions measured 
associations between continuous depressive symptoms (somatic, negative 
affective, and anhedonia subscales, respectively) and plasma ATN(I) biomarkers 
7-years later, adjusting for age, sex, Hispanic/Latino heritage, body mass 
index, APOE status, education, diabetes, cardiovascular disease risk factors 
(smoking, dyslipidemia, hypertension), antidepressant use, and field center.
RESULT: Higher somatic symptoms at Visit 1 were associated with higher ptau-181 
(β= 0.03, 95% CI [-0.05; 0.12]), higher NfL (β= 1.30, CI [-0.52;3.12]), and 
lower GFAP (β= -2.95, CI [-8.36;2.46]) 7-years later, albeit not significantly. 
Higher anhedonia and negative affective symptoms were associated with lower 
ptau-181 (β= -0.05, CI [-0.11;0.01] and β= -0.05, CI [-0.11;0.02], 
respectively), higher NfL (β= 0.02, CI [-0.79;0.83] and β=0.45, CI [-0.78; 1.69] 
respectively), and lower GFAP (β= -2.71, CI [-6.30;0.88] and β= - 2.37, CI 
[-6.49;1.74]).
CONCLUSION: The current work suggests that different depressive symptoms may 
uniquely relate to distinct ATN(I) biomarkers. Future studies will examine the 
potential impact of chronic depressive symptoms as this longitudinal cohort ages 
as well as neurocognitive outcomes, providing a deeper understanding of the 
pathways linking depression to cognitive decline.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate glycemic metrics and insulin delivery during real-world 
use of the MiniMed 780G (MM780G) system on days when users did not administer 
boluses.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Global CareLink personal data of consenting MM780G 
users (N = 369,467) uploaded from 2 January 2020 to 31 March 2025 were analyzed. 
Among these individuals, 54,553 users experienced ≥10 days without any 
user-initiated boluses. Evaluated key metrics included time in range (TIR; 
70-180 mg/dL), time below range (TBR; <70 mg/dL), time above range (>180 mg/dL), 
the glucose management indicator (GMI), and total insulin delivered. These were 
analyzed for the overall population who did not initiate boluses and for those 
who used and did not use recommended optimal settings (ROS; defined as a 100 
mg/dL glucose target and a 2-h active insulin time). Subgroup analyses were 
conducted by age (≤15 or >15 years) and diabetes type (type 1 or 2).
RESULTS: On days when boluses were missed, ROS users had a mean sensor glucose 
(SG) of 149.2 mg/dL, with mean TIR, TBR, and GMI of 76.3%, 0.8%, and 6.9%, 
respectively, whereas non-ROS users had a mean SG of 159.7 mg/dL with mean TIR, 
TBR, and GMI of 69.3%, 0.9%, and 7.1%, respectively. ROS use was associated with 
more individuals achieving consensus TIR, TBR, and GMI goals.
CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate effective glycemic control with the MM780G 
system on days when some users did not initiate boluses. A greater proportion of 
real-world users achieved glycemic goals when ROS were used.

INTRODUCTION: Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) are 
antidiabetic agents that also induce weight loss. Their widespread use has 
prompted investigation of potential benefits beyond glycemic control, including 
effects on male sexual and reproductive function. Emerging evidence suggests 
that they may improve male reproductive parameters, particularly in men with 
metabolic dysfunction.
OBJECTIVES: To systematically evaluate the effects of GLP-1RAs (liraglutide, 
semaglutide, dulaglutide, and exenatide) on male reproductive hormones, semen 
parameters, and metabolic outcomes.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic review following Preferred Reporting Items 
for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. We searched in PubMed, 
Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science up to April 2025. Eligible studies included 
randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies evaluating the effects of 
GLP-1RAs in adult men. Assessed the risk of bias with the risk of bias 2 tool 
for RCT and the Risk Of Bias In Non-Randomized Studies of Interventions 
(ROBINS-I) tool for observational studies.
RESULTS: Ten studies involving a total of 639 men were included. GLP-1RAs were 
consistently associated with increased total testosterone, particularly in men 
with obesity, type 2 diabetes, or functional hypogonadism. Free testosterone 
changes were inconsistent, often offset by concurrent rises in sex 
hormone-binding globulin. Luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone 
levels were preserved or increased with GLP-1RA use, in contrast to the 
suppression observed in testosterone therapy comparator groups. Improvements in 
semen parameters were reported in obese or hypogonadal men; however, no 
significant changes were found in healthy individuals.
CONCLUSION: GLP-1RAs may improve testosterone levels and potentially enhance 
semen quality in men with metabolic issues, while maintaining gonadotropin 
function. They could serve as fertility-sparing alternatives to testosterone 
therapy in some obesity-related hypogonadism cases. More long-term, controlled 
studies with standardized fertility measures are needed to confirm their role in 
male reproductive health.

Information and Support Needs of Clinicians and Food-Insecure Adults With Type 2 
Diabetes: A Systematic Review.

Healthcare, Teesside University, Middlesbrough, UK.

Food insecurity is a growing public health concern in the United Kingdom (UK), 
with significant implications for adults living with type 2 diabetes. This 
systematic review explores how clinicians can identify and support food-insecure 
adults in diabetes care settings. A clinician is defined as a healthcare 
professional who provides direct patient care. Four databases (MEDLINE, Embase, 
CINAHL, APA PsycINFO) and grey literature sources were searched. Eleven 
qualitative and mixed-methods studies from the United States (US), Canada, and 
the UK were included. Using thematic synthesis, three analytical themes were 
developed. The first theme highlights that identifying food insecurity requires 
organisational support and buy-in. Clinicians recognised the importance of 
routine screening, but systemic barriers such as time constraints, lack of 
referral pathways, and limited integration into existing workflows hindered 
implementation. The second theme emphasises the role of trust-based clinical 
relationships in enabling disclosure and patient engagement. Empathy and 
stigma-sensitive communication were found to be essential for patients to feel 
safe discussing food insecurity and engaging with care plans. However, 
unrealistic dietary advice and limited clinician awareness of social needs 
undermine these efforts. The third theme identifies the need for collaboration 
with community organisations. Clinicians reported limited knowledge of local 
food support services and emphasised the importance of system-led referral 
pathways and partnerships to address food insecurity effectively. Patients also 
highlighted challenges such as low food literacy and poor cooking skills, 
reinforcing the need for practical, community-based support. Addressing food 
insecurity in type 2 diabetes care requires more than individual clinician 
effort, it demands coordinated action across healthcare and community sectors to 
improve health outcomes and reduce inequalities. This review calls for a systems 
thinking approach to diabetes care that integrates structural reform, relational 
care, and community collaboration.

Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy Promotes Bone Healing in Patients with Maxillary Sinus 
Lateral Augmentation and Diabetic Mice Potentially through the Nrf2 Pathway.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy on bone 
healing in dia-betic patients and explore potential mechanisms in an animal 
experiment.
METHODS: Four non-diabetic patients undergoing maxillary sinus lateral 
augmentation were assigned to either standard care (control group) or HBO 
treatment for 5, 6 or 9 weeks. Bone core samples were collected for 
immunochemistry during the preparation for implant insertion. Additionally, 12 
db/db diabetic mice and 12 control mice with tibia defects were subjected to HBO 
treatment. After 7 days, the bone repair process was assessed using 
microcomputed tom-ography (microCT), histology, immunohistochemistry and Western 
blot analyses.
RESULTS: HBO improved bone formation in the implant areas of patients treated 
for 5, 6 and 9 weeks, increasing local vascular endothelial growth factor, bone 
morphogenetic protein-2 and osteocalcin expression. Diabetic mice exhibited 
impaired bone healing, but HBO-treated groups (diabetic or non-diabetic) showed 
enhanced new bone formation. Increased osteocalcin and runt-related 
transcription factor 2 and decreased tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 
expression were detected. The nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-related factor 
2 (Nrf2) pathway and its downstream proteins catalase and heme oxygenase-1 were 
upregulated after HBO.
CONCLUSION: HBO enhances bone healing in both patients and diabetic mice, and is 
potentially mediated through the Nrf2 pathway.

High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) is the most lethal gynecologic 
malignancy, typically affecting postmenopausal women. BRCA1 mutation carriers 
are at increased risk of developing early-onset disease. While bariatric surgery 
reduces the incidence of several obesity-related cancers, its potential impact 
on hormonally driven malignancies in genetically predisposed individuals remains 
unclear. We report a rare case of early-onset HGSOC in a 21-year-old woman with 
morbid obesity and type 2 diabetes who underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass in 
2010. Following significant weight loss, she regained regular menstruation and 
discontinued insulin therapy. After progressive weight regain, she underwent 
revisional bariatric surgery in 2020. Three years later, she presented with an 
ovarian cyst and elevated tumor markers. Imaging suggested malignancy, and 
biopsy confirmed HGSOC with a BRCA1 mutation. The patient underwent optimal 
cytoreductive surgery followed by chemotherapy and commenced olaparib 
maintenance therapy. As of September 2024, she remains disease-free. This case 
raises the concern that bariatric surgery, by restoring ovulatory function and 
altering metabolic and hormonal balance, may unmask a latent susceptibility to 
cancer in genetically predisposed patients. The temporal association between 
metabolic surgery and early-onset ovarian cancer warrants further investigation 
into postoperative hormonal shifts and cancer surveillance strategies. Bariatric 
surgery in women with hereditary cancer syndromes should be approached with 
caution. Preoperative genetic counseling, multidisciplinary assessment, and 
long-term oncologic surveillance are essential to ensure patient safety.

Cardiovascular risk factors contribute to the majority of dementia cases, with 
about 20% directly attributable to vascular cognitive impairment and dementia 
(VCID). VCID treatment developments have been slow compared with Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), which now has several FDA-approved symptom- and disease-modifying 
agents. In the second part of this JACC Seminar Series, advances and new 
perspectives on the management and prevention of VCID are reviewed. There is 
reasonable evidence that cognitive enhancers (donepezil, galantamine, and 
memantine) modestly improve cognition in vascular dementia (VaD), the most 
severe form of VCID, especially if there is associated AD pathology. 
Antidepressants may benefit those with depression and stroke, but they have poor 
efficacy in those with depression and VaD alone. Behavioral, social, and 
environmental interventions are first-line therapies for managing 
VCID-associated agitation and psychosis. Second-line antipsychotics have not 
been trialed in those with VaD alone, but are beneficial where AD and VaD 
co-exist, with risperidone and quetiapine effective in reducing psychosis and 
agitation. Primary prevention of VCID includes identifying and managing 
cardiometabolic risk factors along with manifestations of covert cerebrovascular 
disease. Both primary and secondary VCID prevention involve management of 
cardiovascular risks, specifically hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking, 
atrial fibrillation, obesity, and sedentariness. Management of vascular risk 
factors may moderately reduce the risk of incident cognitive impairment. Novel 
interventions currently being evaluated in clinical trials are discussed. The 
discovery and utilization of VCID and AD biomarkers will enhance the specificity 
and effectiveness of interventions such that a precision-medicine approach to 
disease-specific medical therapy may be taken.

Vascular cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID), ie, cognitive impairment 
secondary to cerebrovascular disease (CeVD), is the second most common form of 
dementia after Alzheimer's disease (AD), accounting for 15% to 20% of all cases. 
CeVD, in fact, contributes to dementia alongside other neuropathologies in up to 
75% of dementia cases. CeVD and AD not only frequently co-occur in the brain, 
but they may also interact, and some VCID risk factors (midlife hypertension and 
diabetes) also increase AD risk. Because CeVD and cardiovascular disease share 
risk factors and pathophysiology, the cardiovascular clinician is likely to 
encounter both in the clinic. Moreover, common cardiac disorders, such as atrial 
fibrillation, heart failure, acute coronary syndrome, and valvular disease, 
increase VCID risk. There have been recent developments in the diagnostic 
criteria for VCID, with advances in risk biomarkers, treatment, and prevention 
of cognitive impairment and dementia. The diagnosis of VCID is a 2-step process, 
with the initial identification of a cognitive syndrome followed by the 
establishment of a predominantly vascular etiology, guided by clinical history 
and examination and substantiated by neuroimaging, preferably magnetic resonance 
imaging. Clinical presentations include an acute onset, a stepwise decline, a 
fluctuating course if caused by multiple strokes, or a gradual slow progression 
if attributable to cerebral small vessel disease. Cognitive deficits can be 
found in several domains, such as information-processing speed, attention, 
executive function, and emotional lability, sometimes referred to as the 
subcortical syndrome, often seen in the early stages of VCID without cortical 
infarcts. The diagnosis is supported by the identification of large and small 
infarcts, lacunes, white matter hyperintensities, dilated perivascular spaces 
and cerebral microbleeds using magnetic resonance imaging. This part 1 of a 
2-part JACC review series describes the clinical features, pathophysiology, and 
biomarkers of VCID for cardiovascular clinicians who have a critical role in its 
early identification, management, and prevention in their patients.

INTRODUCTION: High dropout rates during the selection of Special Operations 
Forces (SOF) are well-documented and often linked to inadequate physical 
preparedness and subsequent injuries. Training recommendations in a preparatory 
selection phase may offer a strategy to reduce dropout.
OBJECTIVE: To assess whether fitness-related dropout was reduced in a study 
population of SOF candidates receiving training recommendations after fitness 
assessment, compared to historical attrition rates.
METHODS: Using a prospective observational design, male candidates across Swiss 
Armed Forces and police SOF units received individualized training 
recommendations in the preparation phase of the main selection period. Dropout 
due to inadequate physical preparedness for the demands of SOF selection and 
basic training was tracked through all selection stages. A Bayesian analysis 
compared observed fitness-related dropout rates with a historical control group 
using a Meta-Analytic Predictive approach.
RESULTS: Fitness-related dropout occurred in 29% of participants (40 of 137), 
compared to a historical average of 42%, corresponding to a relative reduction 
of over 30%. The posterior probability of a reduced dropout rate (odds ratio <1) 
was 91.6%.
CONCLUSION: Targeted training guidance as part of human performance management 
may help to reduce fitness-related dropout rates among SOF candidates.

BACKGROUND: Mothers experience increased risk of obesity due to pregnancy and 
caregiving demands. Maternal obesity influences women's health, pregnancy 
outcomes, and children's obesity risk. Effective obesity prevention 
interventions rely on participant engagement. Research suggests that social 
determinants of health (SDOH) influence intervention engagement; however, 
research is limited on how SDOH influence engagement and ways interventions may 
help mothers navigate SDOH.
PURPOSE: Understand how SDOH influence mothers' obesity risk and participation 
in the 24-month Healthy Eating and Active Living Taught at Home (HEALTH) 
intervention delivered by parent educators (PEs) through the Parents as Teachers 
home visiting organization.
METHODS: Semistructured interviews were conducted with participants (mothers) 
from the HEALTH Dissemination and Implementation study. Interviews were 
recorded, transcribed, and analyzed in NVivo using a priori codes and a dual 
nonindependent approach.
RESULTS: Thirteen mothers (five Spanish-speaking, eight English-speaking) were 
interviewed. The most common SDOH influencing health behaviors were neighborhood 
physical activity environment, food environment, and community/social context. 
Mothers felt that HEALTH was needed, available (PEs flexibility to meet 
in-person at home/other locations; virtual meetings), fit their needs/strengths 
(adapted to mothers' health behaviors; motivation for change), and provided 
actionable steps for navigating SDOH (incorporating short walks or stretching at 
home to overcome childcare/time demands). Spanish-speaking mothers benefited 
from shared language and community with PEs.
CONCLUSIONS: Obesity prevention interventions for mothers may help minimize 
negative SDOH and leverage positive SDOH for health behaviors. Interventions 
delivered through community-based home visiting organizations may overcome SDOH 
barriers to intervention engagement through availability and relational 
connections with providers.
CLINICAL TRIAL INFORMATION: The Clinical Trials Registration #NCT03758638.

Plain Language Summary: Mothers are at risk of developing obesity due to 
pregnancy and caregiving demands. Since mothers’ obesity influences their 
health, pregnancy outcomes, and children’s obesity risk, obesity prevention for 
this population is important. Environmental factors (e.g. neighborhood, 
community, food environment) may influence health behaviors (physical activity, 
nutrition) and the ability to participate in interventions. We conducted 
interviews with 13 mothers (five Spanish-speaking, eight English-speaking) 
participating in the 24-month Healthy Eating and Active Living Taught at Home 
(HEALTH) intervention to understand how the environment influences health 
behaviors and intervention participation, and ways it may help them navigate 
environmental barriers/facilitators to health behaviors. We found that the 
physical activity environment (e.g. access to parks), food environment (e.g. 
cost of food), and community (e.g. social support/demands) influenced health 
behaviors. HEALTH was delivered through a home visiting organization (Parents as 
Teachers), which helped overcome environmental barriers to participation through 
flexible in-person/virtual meetings and shared culture/language with the home 
visiting provider. HEALTH helped mothers navigate environmental factors by 
providing health behavior activities to fit busy schedules and childcare 
demands. The environment influenced health behaviors and intervention 
engagement. Obesity prevention interventions delivered through home visiting may 
support navigation of environmental factors for healthy living and participant 
engagement.

BACKGROUND: Diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) are a common and severe disease with 
vascular and/or neurological complications, affecting the patient's health and 
quality of life. Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) is a non-drug treatment method that has 
anti-inflammatory effects, reduces edema, increases neovascularization, 
increases the synthesis of collagen fibers, and accelerates the wound healing 
process. This study aims to evaluate the results of treating patients with 
diabetic foot ulcers with HBO.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A randomized controlled study was conducted. A total of 94 
patients was diagnosed with diabetic foot ulcers, and treated at the Institute 
of Maritime Medicine from January 2021 to December 2023. Study subjects were 
divided into 2 groups: the study group included 43 patients treated with HBO 
combined with intravenous antibiotics, wound care, and control of underlying 
disease; the reference group included 51 patients who were not treated with HBO, 
but were treated with intravenous antibiotics, wound care, and control of 
underlying disease.
RESULTS: The infection status and level of granulation tissue growth of the 
study group were better than the reference group (p < 0.001); the depth and 
diameter of the ulcer in the study group decreased compared to the reference 
group (p < 0.05). Treatment time and amputation rate in the study group were 
reduced in comparison with the reference group: 10.1 ± 4.6 days, 15.1 ± 7.8 days 
and 4.6%, 11.7%.
CONCLUSIONS: Hyperbaric oxygens a good method for treating diabetic foot ulcers, 
helps with anti-inflammation, stimulates the growth of granulation tissue, 
quickly heals ulcers, reduces treatment time, and reduces amputation rates.

BACKGROUND: Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) can be used as a therapeutic 
modality for conditions other than decompression diseases, including wound 
healing in gangrene, compromised grafts and flaps, crush injuries, thermal 
burns, and intracranial abscesses. Beginning more recently, HBOT has also been 
used as an alternative treatment strategy for respiratory conditions in patients 
with COVID-19. This study aimed to determine the use of HBOT in the healing 
processes of the above-listed conditions.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: For this descriptive retrospective study, the authors used 
the data of patients who received HBOT at Manado Regional Hospital in Indonesia 
from January 2017 to December 2020. Patients were identified retrospectively 
according to their ICD-10 codes.
RESULTS: Of the 128 patients who had received HBOT, 60 had received it for 
decompression sickness (46.87%), 29 for thermal burns (22.65%), 19 for diabetic 
ulcers (14.84%), six for crush injuries, six for skin grafts, six for pre- or 
post-amputation (4.68%), and two for gangrene (1.56%).
CONCLUSIONS: Used for decompression sickness in 46.87% of cases and for wound 
healing in 50.13% of cases, HBOT is not only for decompression sickness but can 
be used as a therapeutic modality for other conditions as well.

BACKGROUND: Neuroticism, a personality trait characterized by a tendency to 
experience negative emotions, has been associated with cognitive decline and an 
increased risk of dementia. Examining its association with structural brain 
changes and mediators may highlight underlying biological mechanisms and 
potential intervention targets for at-risk individuals.
METHOD: We included 36,901 dementia-free UK Biobank participants (mean [SD] age 
64.4 [7.7] years). The associations between neuroticism and 1,747 structural MRI 
metrics were assessed using multiple linear regression, adjusted for 
sociodemographic, lifestyle, and imaging-related confounders. The MRI metrics 
included cortical and subcortical volumes, surface area, thickness, intensities, 
ventricular/CSF volumes, and white matter macro- and microstructure. 
Bonferroni-significant associations underwent bidirectional two-sample Mendelian 
randomization (MR) to evaluate the evidence for a causal relationship. Causal 
mediation analyses were performed to assess whether a history of depression, 
anxiety, hypertension, ischemic heart disease (IHD), and diabetes mediated 
Bonferroni-significant observational associations. These conditions were 
selected based on prior MR studies showing unidirectional causal effects of 
neuroticism on their risk, with diabetes included as a negative control due to 
its weak association with neuroticism.
RESULT: Neuroticism was associated with reduced cortical volume and surface 
area, particularly in the frontal and limbic regions. Bonferroni-significant 
associations were observed between neuroticism and lower volumes of medial 
frontal, subcallosal, medial orbitofrontal, and anterior cingulate cortex. 
Neuroticism was also associated with widespread differences in white matter 
microstructure, with the strongest associations observed in the thalamic 
radiations. For example, lower fractional anisotropy, higher diffusivity, and 
lower intracellular volume fraction were identified in the posterior thalamic 
radiations (all Bonferroni-significant). MR analyses supported genetic 
associations between neuroticism and a reduced anterior cingulate cortex surface 
area. Hypertension mediated neuroticism's associations with cortical and white 
matter structures, while depression and anxiety mainly mediated white matter 
microstructure associations (up to 30%). Contributions from IHD and diabetes 
were minimal.
CONCLUSION: Neuroticism was associated with widespread structural differences, 
including lower volumes in frontal and limbic regions and impaired 
microstructure in the thalamic radiations, partially mediated by mental and 
vascular conditions. Further research is needed to strengthen evidence of 
causality in these pathways and explore their roles in cognitive decline and 
dementia.

retinal inflammatory diseases.
METHODS: This retrospective observational study included patients who received 
either intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide (IVTA/TA group) or dexamethasone 
intravitreal implant (DEX group) for the management of retinal vascular diseases 
in the period of 2018-23. SI-OHT in those patients were followed up for 2 years. 
Steroid responders and nonresponders were characterized based on intraocular 
pressure (IOP) change from the baseline. The incidence, risk factors, and 
magnitude of IOP rise and its association with ocular and systemic illness were 
investigated.
RESULTS: Out of 1178 reviewed, 761 patients were excluded due to irregular 
follow-up. A total of 382 patients (382 eyes) who received either IVTA/DEX 
intravitreal implant during the study period were reviewed. The incidence of 
SI-OHT was found to be 46.3% (IVTA group) and 20.8% (DEX group) at 6 months, 
respectively. Among patients who received 2 mg IVTA dosage, 16.9% were steroid 
responders and 11.9% for the 4 mg group.
CONCLUSION: We found that the incidence of SI-OHT was higher in IVTA group as 
compared to DEX group. No dose-dependent incidence was observed in the case of 
IVTA group. Age, gender, number of injections, and myopia were not associated 
with the risk of SI-OHT. Renal disease showed a significant association with the 
risk of SI-OHT in the DEX group, and patients with TB, stroke, and other drug 
allergies experienced a fivefold greater increase in IOP values in those groups.

OBJECTIVE: Shift work is associated with various leading causes of premature 
death, which has been linked with individuals with specific chronotypes. This 
study synthesized evidence on chronotype's role in associations between ever 
shift work and health outcomes.
METHODS: Six databases were searched (inception-September 2025) for 
cohort/case-control studies assessing chronotype-specific shift work impacts on 
breast/prostate cancer, diabetes mellitus, and mental health. PRISMA guidelines 
were used for reporting.
RESULTS: Fourteen studies were included in the review, comprising 2247 breast 
cancer cases, 3045 prostate cancer cases, 336 218 participants in diabetes 
studies, and 2128 poor mental health cases. Compared to daytime workers, both 
night shift workers with morning or evening chronotypes were more susceptible to 
breast cancer [morning type: pooled odds ratio (OR) 1.54, 95% confidence 
interval (CI) 1.01-2.37; evening type: pooled OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.04-1.90) and 
poor mental health (morning type: pooled OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.12-1.27; evening 
type: pooled OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.05-1.17]. Notably, night shift workers with 
evening chronotype were 84% more likely to develop prostate cancer than daytime 
workers. A positive dose-response relationship was identified between cumulative 
years of night shifts and prostate cancer among night shift workers with evening 
chronotype, indicating a 2.1% increase in risk for each additional year 
(P=0.012).
CONCLUSIONS: Chronotype-matched scheduling does not effectively mitigate night 
shift risks. Nevertheless, evening chronotype night shift workers are 
particularly susceptible to various chronic non-communicable diseases, with a 
notable positive dose-response relationship observed between prostate cancer and 
evening chronotype night shift workers.

CONTEXT: Patients with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 1 (MEN1) are 
genetically predisposed to developing tumors of the parathyroid, pancreas, and 
anterior pituitary. While widespread genetic testing has increased early 
diagnoses, the value of radiological surveillance for pituitary adenomas in 
these patients remains unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of pituitary MRI findings on patient 
management in MEN1.
DESIGN: Retrospective Longitudinal Cohort Study.
SETTING: NIH Clinical Center.
PATIENTS: Genetically confirmed MEN1 evaluated between 1977- September 2024.
MEASURES: Cumulative proportion and rate of intervention for non-functional 
adenomas.
RESULTS: 320 patients with a mean follow-up duration of 14 ± 12 years were 
identified. 182/320 patients (57%) had pituitary adenomas, of whom 95/182 (52%) 
had non-functional adenomas. All patients with adenoma had biochemical 
evaluation at the time of pituitary MRI. There were 21/95 (22%) patients with 
non-functional adenomas that needed an intervention throughout their follow-up. 
The rate of intervention per 100 patient years for non-functional adenomas was 
3.1% (CI 2.0-4.7%). All patients with non-functional adenoma who required an 
intervention reported symptoms or had an abnormal pituitary function test. Tumor 
volume of 38/48 (79%) non-functional adenomas followed over a mean of 8.3 ± 6.1 
years remained stable. Only 42/518 (8.1%) MRIs for non-functional adenomas were 
prompted by clinical or biochemical abnormalities. Individualized imaging could 
have avoided approximately four MRIs per patient with non-functional 
micro-adenoma over their follow-up.
CONCLUSION: In an overwhelming majority of patients with MEN1, radiological 
surveillance for non-functional pituitary adenomas offers minimal added benefit 
beyond patient-reported symptoms and pituitary function testing.

CTLA-4, PTNP-22 and FOXO-3A gene variants as genetic biomarkers for the 
co-occurrence of type 1 diabetes with autoimmune thyroid diseases in the Polish 
population.

Cichocka E, Maj-Podsiadło A, Szweda-Gandor N, Gumprecht J.

INTRODUCTION:  Genetic predisposition is a common determinant of autoimmune 
endocrinopathies, particularly type 1 diabetes (T1D) and autoimmune thyroid 
disease (AITD). Although their coexistence is frequent, the underlying genetic 
background is not fully understood.
OBJECTIVES:  To identify genetic polymorphisms predictive of increased risk for 
co-occurring T1D and AITD and to assess their potential impact on glycemic 
control.
PATIENTS AND METHODS:  We genotyped five selected polymorphisms (rs3087243, 
rs231775 in CTLA-4; rs12730735 in PTPN-22; rs2802292, rs9400239 in FOXO-3A) in 
277 patients with T1D. Clinical data on thyroid status, the presence of thyroid 
antibodies, treatment, and metabolic control were analyzed.
RESULTS:  Thyroid disorders were diagnosed in 32.9% of patients, mostly 
Hashimoto's hypothyroidism. 75% required L-thyroxine (mean TSH 2.15 IU/L). Among 
TPO- and TG-positive patients, 81.6% and 75% had prior thyroid diagnoses. The GG 
genotype of rs3087243 (CTLA-4) conferred a higher risk of hypothyroidism and 
other thyroid diseases. The GG variant of rs2802292 (FOXO-3A) was associated 
with reduced family history of thyroid disease. Carriers of AG genotypes in 
rs3087243 and rs231775 (CTLA-4), as well as the GG genotype in rs2802292 
(FOXO-3A), showed a lower probability of achieving diabetes control, 
particularly with longer disease duration. However, the CT genotype of 
rs12730735 (PTPN-22) increased the likelihood of achieving glycemic control.
CONCLUSIONS:  CTLA-4 polymorphisms were associated with an elevated risk of 
thyroid disease and poorer glycemic control; FOXO-3A showed a dual role, i.e. 
protective against familial thyroid disease but unfavorable for glycemic 
regulation; PTPN-22 variant improved glycemic control. Genetic profiling may 
enhance risk assessment and management in T1D.

Fibraurea tinctoria Lour has long been used by the indigenous ethnic groups of 
Kalimantan in the traditional treatment of malaria, jaundice, and diabetes 
mellitus. This study aimed to evaluate the drug-likeness and ADMET properties of 
the active compounds berberine, palmatine, and jatrorrhizine and to assess the 
acute toxicity of the plant extract using in silico and in vivo approaches. In 
silico analysis was performed using the pkCSM, ProTox-II, and SwissADME online 
web servers to predict drug-likeness and ADMET of compounds from Fibraurea 
tinctoria Lour. The in vivo acute toxicity of the extract was evaluated 
according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) 
425 guideline. In silico studies have demonstrated that berberine, palmatine, 
and jatrorrhizine exhibit favorable drug-likeness and pharmacokinetic properties 
but indicate potential oral toxicity. In contrast, the in vivo acute toxicity 
study revealed no toxicity or adverse effects, with an LD50 greater than 
5000 mg/kg. These findings indicate that despite the in silico prediction 
showing the potential toxicity of these three compounds, the extract exhibited 
relative safety based on in vivo tests and has the potential for further 
pharmacological development.

Technology and Education, Ho Chi Minh City, 70000, Vietnam, hcmute.edu.vn.

This study explores the effects of a low glycemic index starch (HR0) produced 
through double thermal retrogradation (4°C/18 h-30°C/6 h), on the physiology and 
behavior of mice. HR0 starch exhibited low in vitro and in vivo glycemic indexes 
of 37 and 51, respectively. Mice fed a high-fat diet supplemented with 33% HR0 
starch showed significant reductions in body weight compared to those on a 
high-fat diet. HR0 supplementation normalized fasting plasma glucose levels in 
mice, preventing the development of diabetes, while all other high-fat diet 
groups developed diabetic symptoms. Blood lipid analysis indicated that HR0 
reduced triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, and total cholesterol levels while 
increasing HDL cholesterol. Histological examinations showed that HR0 improved 
the health of liver, kidney, and adipose tissues, notably reducing the incidence 
of fatty liver disease. Behavioral tests demonstrated that HR0 starch enhanced 
locomotor activity and reduced anxiety levels. These results suggest that HR0 
starch can effectively improve metabolic health and may serve as a beneficial 
dietary supplement for individuals at risk of obesity, diabetes, and 
cardiovascular diseases.

BACKGROUND: Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a multifactorial complication of 
diabetes involving mitochondrial dysfunction and immune cell infiltration. 
However, the causal relationships remain unclear.
METHODS: We applied Mendelian randomization (MR) and single-cell RNA sequencing 
(scRNA-seq) to investigate the roles of mitochondrial gene expression and immune 
cells in DKD. Additionally, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from DKD 
patients were analyzed for differential gene expression.
RESULTS: Higher expression of mitochondrial genes PCCB, ACADM, ADHFE1, OCIAD1, 
and FIS1 increased DKD risk, while genes like NT5DC2, ATP5MC3, and GLYCTK 
decreased risk. Immune traits, including human leukocyte antigen 
(HLA)-DR + plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), mediated the effects of 
mitochondrial dysfunction on DKD. scRNA-seq revealed significant downregulation 
of ATP5MC3, GLYCTK, and NT5DC2 in podocytes (PODOs) and tubular cells in DKD 
kidneys, alongside increased infiltration of helper T cells, B cells, dendritic 
cells (DCs), and plasma cells. PBMC analysis highlighted the upregulation of 
proinflammatory genes (CXCL2, CXCL3, and others) in DKD patients.
CONCLUSION: This study highlights the complex interplay between mitochondrial 
dysfunction and immune cell infiltration in DKD pathogenesis. Key mitochondrial 
genes and immune traits identified here offer novel therapeutic targets such as 
ATP5MC3, GLYCTK, and DC pathways.

Oxidative stress, driven by an imbalance between oxidants and antioxidants, 
disrupts redox homeostasis and contributes to the development of chronic 
diseases, including cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders, and aging. 
The NRF2-KEAP1 pathway is a pivotal cellular defense mechanism against oxidative 
stress, regulating the transcription of cytoprotective genes. Pharmacological 
NRF2 activation has emerged as a promising strategy to mitigate oxidative 
stress-related pathologies; however, challenges regarding target specificity, 
pharmacodynamics, efficacy, and safety remain unresolved. Isoeugenol, a 
phenylpropanoid found in essential oils, has traditionally been recognized as a 
skin allergen but is now gaining attention for its potential as an NRF2 
activator. Emerging evidence suggests that isoeugenol exerts antioxidant, 
anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective effects and modulates metabolic disorders 
such as diabetes mellitus. Despite its therapeutic potential, the direct 
correlation between isoeugenol's effects and NRF2 activation remains 
underexplored. Existing studies indicate that isoeugenol may activate NRF2 
through multiple mechanisms, including covalent modification of KEAP1 cysteine 
residues, increased AKT activation and GSK3β inactivation, and glutathione 
depletion leading to reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Understanding 
these activation pathways is critical for leveraging isoeugenol as a therapeutic 
agent. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of isoeugenol's role in 
modulating NRF2 activity and its implications for treating oxidative 
stress-driven diseases. By integrating current findings, this review highlights 
new insights into the therapeutic potential of isoeugenol in translational 
medicine. We propose future research directions to optimize its application in 
clinical settings, paving the way for more targeted and effective NRF2-based 
interventions in chronic disease management.

Drying regimes strongly shape fruit-polysaccharide structure and antidiabetic 
function, yet their structure-function consequences in Pyracantha fortuneana 
remain unclear. Six scalable methods-natural (ND), hot-air (HD), infrared (IRD), 
freeze-drying (FD), microwave-vacuum (MVD), and freeze-microwave-vacuum drying 
(FMVD)-were therefore compared for their effects on P. fortuneana fruit 
polysaccharides (PFPs). FMVD produced the highest polysaccharide yield (6.22 %) 
and uronic acid content (45.48 %), while lowering weight-average molecular 
weight from 740.47 to 134.08 kDa relative to ND and generating 
low-crystallinity, thermally stable polymers. These structural advantages 
translated into superior bioactivity: PFP-FMVD showed the strongest 
α-glucosidase inhibition with an IC50 of 0.51 mg/mL. In a BSA-glucose model, 
PFP-FMVD most effectively attenuated the Maillard cascade, inhibiting early 
fructosamine formation by 62.27 % at 8 mg/mL and reducing fluorescent advanced 
glycation end products (AGEs) with an IC50 of 3.48 mg/mL. Multivariate 
correlation, kinetic, and spectroscopic analyses established a quantitative 
structure-activity rule: higher galacturonic/uronic acid content and lower 
molecular weight, together with stronger static, mixed-type binding to 
α-glucosidase and helix-to-sheet transitions in the enzyme, underpin enhanced 
dual antihyperglycemic and antiglycation activities. FMVD is thus identified as 
the most effective drying strategy for engineering PFPs with optimized 
functional performance, providing mechanistic guidance for designing 
polysaccharide-based functional ingredients for diabetes management.

INTRODUCTION: Frailty is a common adverse outcome in diabetes that is linked to 
reduced quality of life and increased mortality and is strongly associated with 
insulin resistance. However, the relationship between long-term cumulative 
insulin resistance and frailty progression remains unclear, particularly in 
Chinese adults with diabetes.
METHODS: We used data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study. 
We included 451 participants aged 45 years or older with baseline diabetes in 
2011 who had frailty index scores based on 26 health deficit items across four 
waves (2011, 2015, 2018, 2020) and complete data in 2011 and 2015 to calculate 
cumulative estimated glucose disposal rate, cumulative triglyceride-glucose 
index, and cumulative triglyceride-glucose-body mass index. Linear mixed-effects 
models with random intercepts, adjusted for baseline age, sex, smoking, alcohol 
consumption, baseline estimated glucose disposal rate, and cardiovascular 
disease history, were used to examine the interaction between standardized 
cumulative indices and time in years on frailty index trajectories. Prespecified 
subgroup interactions were also evaluated.
RESULTS: Only the interaction between cumulative estimated glucose disposal rate 
and time was statistically significant. A higher cumulative estimated glucose 
disposal rate was associated with a slower annual increase in frailty index 
(interaction beta = -0.0019 per year, 95% confidence interval -0.0035 to 
-0.0002, P = 0.028), whereas cumulative triglyceride-glucose index and 
cumulative triglyceride-glucose-body mass index were not associated with the 
rate of frailty change. Subgroup analyses did not identify statistically 
significant effect modification by sex, age group, baseline frailty level, 
baseline cardiovascular disease, residence, or education.
DISCUSSION: Higher cumulative estimated glucose disposal rate, reflecting better 
sustained insulin sensitivity over four years, was associated with a slower 
nine-year frailty progression among middle-aged and older Chinese adults with 
diabetes. Although the effect size is modest and causality cannot be inferred, 
cumulative estimated glucose disposal rate may serve as a useful indicator for 
long-term risk assessment and longitudinal monitoring of frailty.

BACKGROUND AND HYPOTHESIS: Kidney replacement therapy (KRT) practices in Europe 
are heterogeneous, with apparent differences between Western and Central/Eastern 
Europe. However, time trends in KRT incidence and prevalence in Central and 
Eastern Europe are not previously reported. Therefore, we aimed to describe 
trends in incidence and prevalence of KRT in Central and Eastern Europe from 
2010 to 2021.
METHODS: Data on incident and prevalent KRT patients from 19 Central and Eastern 
European countries between the years 2010 and 2021 were derived from the 
European Renal Association (ERA) Registry. Time trends were calculated using 
JoinPoint regression.
RESULTS: Overall, KRT incidence increased with 1.5% (95% confidence interval 
(CI): +0.7 to + 2.6%) per year from 106.3 per million population (pmp) in 2010 
to 119.6 pmp in 2019. However, trends differed within the region. While in 
Bosnia and Herzegovina KRT incidence significantly decreased from 2010 to 2019, 
it remained stable in nine and increased in eight countries. The overall KRT 
prevalence increased with 5.1% (95% CI: +4.5 to + 5.7%) per year from 426.2 pmp 
in 2010 to 651.2 pmp in 2019. KRT prevalence increased in all countries, except 
for Belarus where it remained stable, and was mainly attributable to increases 
in the prevalence of kidney transplantation. The COVID-19 pandemic did not have 
a major impact on KRT incidence and prevalence in the region, as most trends 
remained until 2021.
CONCLUSIONS: Although we found an overall increase in KRT incidence and 
prevalence in the region, large country variations remain, much larger than 
observed in Western Europe. The results of this study can help to define 
country-specific priorities for the optimization of KRT care in Central and 
Eastern Europe.

Challenges and Pitfalls in Diagnosing and Managing Severe Gestational 
Hypercalcaemia.

A 38-yr-old primigravida presented at 30 + 2 wk' gestation with 
pregnancy-induced hypertension and was found to have severe hypercalcaemia 
(adjusted calcium 3.19 mmol/L). Intravenous fluid therapy produced only 
transient improvement, and recurrent hypercalcaemia required repeated inpatient 
management. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) was suppressed, while both 25(OH)D₃ and 
1,25(OH)₂D₃ (calcitriol) were elevated. Imaging and laboratory investigations 
revealed no evidence of malignancy or granulomatous disease. Delivery by 
elective caesarean section was undertaken at 35 wk' gestation. The neonate 
developed transient hypocalcaemia with suppressed PTH, requiring brief 
intravenous calcium supplementation. Maternal hypercalcaemia persisted 
postpartum, and renal imaging revealed nephrolithiasis and nephrocalcinosis. 
Serum calcium remained elevated during lactation but normalized after weaning. 
Extended vitamin D metabolite profiling showed an increased 
25(OH)D₃:24,25(OH)₂D₃ ratio, and genetic analysis confirmed compound 
heterozygous pathogenic variants in CYP24A1, encoding vitamin D 24-hydroxylase, 
the enzyme responsible for calcitriol degradation. The findings established a 
diagnosis of gestational hypercalcaemia due to CYP24A1 deficiency. Normal 
pregnancy is associated with physiological rises in calcitriol, reduced PTH, and 
hypercalciuria, features that can mimic or mask this disorder. This case 
illustrates the diagnostic challenges of recognizing CYP24A1 deficiency in 
pregnancy.

IMPORTANCE: Area-based indicators of social determinants of health (SDOH) are 
associated with higher risk for acquired heart disease, but their impact on 
conditions with a strong genetic etiology, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 
(HCM), is not well understood.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the association of area-based SDOH with clinical 
outcomes in patients with HCM.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This multicenter, prospective cohort study 
was conducted among US adult patients with HCM from 5 sites in the Sarcomeric 
Human Cardiomyopathy Registry (a multicenter prospective registry of patients 
with HCM) who were followed up for a median (IQR) period of 2.15 (0.15-5.82) 
years. Data were entered from 2015 to March 2024, and data analysis was 
completed from March 2024 to June 2025.
EXPOSURES: Patients' residential addresses were geocoded at the zip code level 
and linked to the American Communities Survey to estimate area-based (1) median 
household income and (2) social deprivation index (SDI), which ranges from 0 to 
100, with higher scores indicating a more deprived area.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Multivariate models, adjusting for age at diagnosis, 
body mass index, hypertension, and sex, were used to estimate the independent 
association of area-based median household income and SDI with heart failure 
(HF), ventricular arrhythmias (VA), and an overall composite outcome (VA, HF, 
atrial fibrillation, stroke, and death).
RESULTS: Among 4431 US adult patients with HCM, median (IQR) age at HCM 
diagnosis was 51.3 (38.9-61.6) years, and 1862 patients (42.0%) were female. 
Median (IQR) area-based household income was $80 000 ($60 000-$110 000), and 
median (IQR) SDI was 25 (10-55). Adjusted hazard ratios comparing the lowest 
income group to the highest income group were 2.07 (95% CI, 1.77-2.42; P < .001) 
for HF, 1.31 (95% CI, 0.97-1.78; P = .08) for VA, and 1.52 (95% CI, 1.36-1.69; 
P < .001) for the overall composite outcome. Adjusted hazard ratios comparing 
the highest SDI (ie, more deprived) group to the lowest SDI group were 1.48 (95% 
CI, 1.29-1.70; P < .001) for HF, 1.55 (95% CI, 1.15-2.09; P = .004) for VA, and 
1.36 (95% CI, 1.22-1.50; P < .001) for the overall composite outcome.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this multicenter cohort study, residing in an area 
with lower median household income or worse SDI were each independently 
associated with adverse clinical outcomes in patients with HCM. These findings 
suggest that despite the genetically determined nature of HCM, place of 
residence is associated with patient outcomes.

INTRODUCTION: Obesity represents a significant public health problem, 
particularly due to its strong association with additional cardiovascular risk 
factors, such as hypertension, insulin resistance (IR), type 2 diabetes 
mellitus, metabolic syndrome (MS) and cardiovascular disease. IR is the 
underlying factor of the relationship between obesity and metabolic 
dysregulation. The identification of IR is crucial for early diagnosis, clinical 
management and specific treatment.
AIM: This study aims to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of the 
Triglycerides/Glucose (TyG) Index in identifying IR and target-organ damage in a 
cohort of patients with essential hypertension.
METHODS: we have evaluated 235 consecutive patients with essential hypertension 
(50.1% men and 49.9% women; mean age 51.9 ± 17.3 years), stratified for body 
mass index (BMI). Biochemical analysis and instrumental evaluation were assessed 
to identify target-organ damage.
RESULTS: Increased BMI was associated with higher values of blood pressure, 
glycaemia and triglycerides. In patients with higher BMI, we observed more 
prevalent target-organ damage, particularly cardiac remodeling (78.3%) and 
higher 24-h urinary albumin excretion (83.7±48 mg/L). The TyG index proved to be 
a stronger biomarker for identifying the development of MS (AUC 0.78) and 
cardiac remodeling (AUC 0.66).
CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that obesity is correlated with a impaired 
hemodynamic and metabolic profile. The TyG index could represent an efficient 
and easy-to-use indicator for identifying both individuals developing MS and 
early cardiac remodeling, especially in normal-weight subjects.

BACKGROUND: Plasma ceramides are recognized biomarkers of cardiovascular risk; 
however, racial and ethnic differences in their levels, as well as their 
association with cardiovascular health (CVH) among African-American populations, 
remain insufficiently studied.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess the association between ceramide scores 
and CVH, as well as atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk, among 
African-American adults, and to compare ceramide scores between African-American 
and White adults.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a secondary analysis of 2 U.S. studies 
including African-American and White adults. Collected data encompassed 
demographics, behavioral factors (e.g., diet) and clinical measures (e.g., 
plasma ceramide levels). Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk was 
assessed using the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association 
(ACC/AHA) 10-year pooled cohort equations, while CVH was evaluated using the 
American Heart Association (AHA) Life's Essential 8 (LE8) scoring system.
RESULTS: Fifty-eight African-American adults (mean age: 54.6 years; 67.2% women) 
and 1,103 White adults (mean age: 64.5 years; 52.1% women) were included. 
Compared with White participants, African-Americans had significantly higher 
prevalence of obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia, but similar 
ASCVD risk (12.8% vs 12.6%; p = 0.65). No significant associations were observed 
between ceramide scores and either LE8 or ASCVD risk in African-Americans. 
Ceramide levels differed by race/ethnicity, with African-Americans showing lower 
concentrations of 18:0 (0.08 vs 0.10 μmol/L) and 24:1 (0.91 vs 1.17 μmol/L) 
species compared with White adults (both p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: No association was observed between ceramide scores and CVH or ASCVD 
risk in African-American adults. Despite having a less favorable cardiometabolic 
profile, African-Americans exhibited lower ceramide levels than White adults. 
These findings suggest that ceramide scores may not accurately reflect 
cardiovascular risk in African-American populations.

BACKGROUND: Fasting, practiced in clinical, cultural, and faith-based contexts, 
has emerged as a non-pharmacological strategy capable of modulating multiple 
physiological systems. Contemporary evidence suggests that diverse fasting 
patterns (intermittent and time-restricted fasting, Ramadan fasting, 
alternate-day and periodic fasting, dry fasting, and fasting-mimicking diets) 
converge on shared metabolic-circadian-immune pathways and can be conceptualized 
within an integrated resilience framework.
AIM: This narrative review synthesizes current experimental and human data on 
fasting as a multisystem health modulator, linking metabolic, cardiovascular, 
immune, gut-liver-microbiome, neurocognitive, endocrine, and psychospiritual 
effects to common regulatory axes, particularly the Metabolic-Circadian-Immune 
(MCI) and Energy-Information-Resilience (EIR) models.
RESULTS: Across fasting modalities, activation of energy-sensing pathways 
(AMPK-SIRT1-mTOR), metabolic switching to lipolysis and ketogenesis, enhanced 
autophagy/mitophagy, and improved insulin sensitivity have been shown to support 
the management of obesity, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and 
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Fasting also modulates immune and 
inflammatory tone, reshapes the gut microbiome, and may benefit autoimmune 
conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis. Cardiovascular, 
endocrine, and neurocognitive domains show improvements in blood pressure, lipid 
profiles, neurotrophic signaling, mood, and cognitive resilience, while 
structured religious fasting (e.g., Ramadan) can additionally reinforce 
psychological discipline and spiritual well-being. At the same time, responses 
are heterogeneous, and prolonged or intensive regimens may pose risks in 
vulnerable populations.
CONCLUSION: Fasting can be viewed as a low-cost, multidimensional 
"biopsychospiritual" health intervention acting through interconnected 
metabolic, circadian, immune, and neurobehavioral pathways. By integrating 
traditional and religious fasting practices with contemporary mechanistic and 
clinical data, this review highlights shared energy- and immune-regulatory axes 
and underscores the potential of fasting within integrative, preventive, and 
personalized care. Standardized protocols, long-term outcomes, and multimodal 
trials combining immunophenotyping, microbiome/metabolomic profiling, and 
neuroimaging remain priorities for future research.

INTRODUCTION/OBJECTIVES : Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a crucial 
manifestation of systemic sclerosis (SSc), which has not been studied much in 
Asians.
METHODS: The electronic medical records of 110 SSc patients between April 2000 
and December 2020 were comprehensively examined, including clinical 
manifestations, laboratory tests, pulmonary functions, and high-resolution 
computerized tomography (HRCT) of the chest.
RESULTS: Among 26 men and 84 women with a median age of 61 years in SSc cohort, 
52 (47.3%) presented with ILD. The actual prevalence of ILD in SSc cohort was 
estimated between 10.5% and 47.3%. The most common form was usual interstitial 
pneumonitis (UIP). The total lung capacity (TLC)/diffusion capacity of carbon 
monoxide (DLCO), renal function, and CRP were poorer in the SSc-ILD who smoked 
less than the counterpart without ILD. A weighted score incorporated from 
essential parameters (risk of ILD = TLC - 0.1 × ESR - 1.5 × CRP) has modest 
power (ROC AUC 0.7242) to predict ILD. The main causes of death in the SSc-ILD 
were infections (72.7%), pulmonary hypertension (PH, OR = 18.81, 95% 
CI = 2.11-167.70), and renal failure (OR = 33.6, 95% CI = 2.00-546.10).
CONCLUSION: The SSc-ILD have lower TLC/DLCO, higher CRP, and poorer renal 
function than the SSc without ILD. Early-onset dyspnea, PH, and renal failure 
may be independent risk factors for mortality in SSc-ILD. Key Points • 110 SSc 
(M: F=26:84) were retrospectively analyzed for ILD, with 10.5-47.3% presenting 
with ILD (UIP the most). • Risk of ILD in SSc = TLC - 0.1 ×  ESR - 1.5 × CRP can 
apply in this cohort. • Death originated from infections, PH, and renal failure 
in addition to early-onset dyspnea in this cohort.

PURPOSE: To retrospectively evaluate the efficacy and safety of Micropulse 
Transscleral Cyclophotocoagulation (MP-TSCPC) in reducing intraocular pressure 
(IOP) and the number of glaucoma medications in patients with different types of 
glaucoma over a two-year period.
METHODS: This retrospective audit included 52 eyes from 32 patients treated with 
MP-TSCPC at Mountainhall Treatment Centre, Dumfries, UK, between August 2021 and 
September 2023. Standard treatment parameters included 2500 mW power applied for 
10 s per quadrant across 9 cycles. Primary outcomes were changes in IOP and the 
number of glaucoma medications. Secondary outcomes included postoperative 
complications and changes in the mean deviation of the visual field (MD).
RESULTS: The mean preoperative IOP was 21.4 mmHg, which significantly decreased 
postoperatively to 11.9 mmHg at 4 weeks, 12.75 mmHg at 3 months, 13.4 mmHg at 1 
year, and 14.03 mmHg at 2 years. The median IOP reduction at 1 year was 5.0 mmHg 
with statistical significance (p < 0.0001). The average number of topical 
medications declined from 2.21 eye drops to 1.58 eye drops. No statistically 
significant change was observed in visual field MD (p = 0.4838), though disease 
progression appeared to stabilize (mean MD: -7.1 dB). Complications were 
infrequent and included mild anterior uveitis (n = 12), cystoid macular edema, 
recurrence of herpetic keratitis and severe ocular inflammation (n = 1).
CONCLUSION: MP-TSCPC is a safe and effective procedure for medium-term IOP 
control, particularly in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma. It 
significantly reduces IOP and medication dependency, with a low complication 
profile. However, outcomes are more variable in secondary glaucoma, especially 
uveitic cases. These findings support the growing role of MP-TSCPC as a 
minimally invasive treatment option for glaucoma.

PURPOSE: Portal hypertension (PoH) after liver transplantation is a severe 
complication that results in graft loss. We investigated the characteristics and 
evaluated the treatment outcomes of PoH after living donor liver transplantation 
(LDLT).
METHODS: This single-center, retrospective cohort study included 325 LDLT 
recipients.
RESULTS: Of the subjects, 37 (11.4%) had a PoH. The 10- and 20-year graft 
survival rates were significantly lower in patients with PoH than in those 
without PoH (69.1% vs. 90.8% and 42.1% vs. 84.7%, respectively; p < 0.0001). The 
types of PoH were pre-hepatic, hepatic, and post-hepatic in 16, 13, and 8 
patients, respectively. Interventional radiology was performed for PoH in all 
post-hepatic PoH patients and in 62.5% of pre-hepatic PoH patients. Notably, 
46.2% of the patients with hepatic PoH required re-transplantation. The 10-year 
graft survival rate was significantly worse in patients with hepatic PoH than in 
those with pre- and post-hepatic PoH (46.2% vs. 86.7% and 75.0%, respectively; 
P < 0.05). Post-transplant PoH was an independent predictor of graft loss after 
LDLT (hazard ratio, 5.73; 95% confidence interval: 2.43-13.55, P < 0.0005).
CONCLUSIONS: Post-transplant PoH negatively affected the graft survival in LDLT 
recipients. Pre-hepatic, hepatic, and post-hepatic PoH cases had different 
characteristics, requiring different treatments. Therefore, an appropriate 
diagnosis and treatment are important.

Background The objective of this study was to ascertain whether cardiometabolic 
index(CMI), visceral adiposity index (VAI), dysfunctional adiposity index (DAI), 
and body adiposity index (BAI) are superior predictors of future hypertension 
risk when compared with conventional indicators such as waist circumference(WC), 
body mass index (BMI) and waist-to-height ratio(WHtR).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is a post hoc analysis of the MONICA protocol. We 
selected 597 patients based on inclusions criteria. Data collection began in 
1992, and follow-up was conducted on the same group of participants in 2007. The 
study collected anthropometric indexes and biochemical data.
RESULTS: After adjusting for confounding factors using multivariate Cox 
regression analysis, the following results were observed: CMI [HR: 1.754 
(1.240-2.480); P = 0.001], VAI [HR: 1.533 (1.074-2.187); P = 0.018], DAI [HR: 
1.382 (0.982-1.945); P = 0.064], BAI [HR: 2.791 (1.790-4.352); P < 0.001], WC 
[HR: 2.234 (1.510-3.307); P < 0.001], WHtR [HR: 2.303 (1.589-3.339); P < 0.001], 
and BMI [HR: 2.488 (1.778-3.561); P < 0.001] were all significantly associated 
with the incidence of hypertension. ROC curve analysis showed that the area 
under the curve (AUC) for WC product was the highest (0.649, 95% CI: 
0.605-0.693), followed by BMI (0.648, 95% CI: 0.603-0.692), WHtR (0.646, 95% CI: 
0.601-0.690), and then by CMI (0.603, 95% CI: 0.557-0.649).
CONCLUSIONS: Although the CMI, VAI, DAI and BAI can all be utilised as 
independent predictors of hypertension, the predictive discriminatory power of 
these novel indicators for hypertension remains inferior to that of traditional 
indicators such as WC, BMI and WHtR.

Understanding the direct connections between metabolism and chromatin dynamics 
may uncover potential mechanisms involved in the aging process of renal 
physiology. Despite known differences in incidence and aging renal disease, how 
biological aging intersects with renal metabolism and epigenetics in a 
sex-specific context remains poorly understood. Here, we determined the effect 
of age on renal metabolic pathways and metabolite cofactors of epigenetic 
modifiers in a sex-specific manner. We measured metabolites in kidney 
homogenates from young and aged mice by HPLC-TripleTOF (LC-MS). The major 
metabolic adaptations observed with aging include increased glycolysis, 
decreased fatty acid oxidation, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and 
impaired metabolic waste clearance in 24-month-old (aged) mice compared to 
4-month-old (young) sex-matched mice. Additionally, we found elevated levels of 
methylation and acetylation of intermediate metabolites also known as 
'epimetabolites' in aged mice. Furthermore, age-related alterations were 
detected in metabolites (acetyl-coenzyme A, flavin adenine dinucleotide, and 
α-ketoglutarate) that are essential cofactors for the activities of epigenetic 
enzymes. Sex-specific changes were observed with age such as, significantly 
enhanced amino acid catabolism and tryptophan metabolism and reduced 
lysophospholipase activity and ammonia clearance in aged female vs aged male 
mice. Our results reveal age- and sex-associated alterations in renal metabolic 
pathways, characterized by an increase in epigenetically modified intermediate 
metabolites with aging. These findings suggest a complex interplay between renal 
metabolomics and epigenetics and offer new insights into the mechanisms 
underlying sex-specific renal physiology of aging kidneys.

The epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) localized in the cell membrane is crucial 
for sodium transport and blood pressure regulation. Discovered in frog skin, 
ENaC is expressed in the colon, lungs, exocrine glands, and most notably in the 
distal nephron of the kidneys, where it limits sodium reabsorption. Mutations in 
ENaC cause hereditary hypertension (Liddle's syndrome) or hypotension 
(pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1). ENaC activity and expression are tightly 
controlled by various signaling molecules and second messengers. For example, 
urinary ATP binding to the P2Y2 receptor inhibits ENaC. ENaC also interacts with 
PI(4,5)P2 and the ubiquitin ligase Nedd4-2 via specific motifs. PI(4,5)P2 is 
essential for ENaC stability, trafficking, and gating. This review focuses on 
the regulatory roles of the P2Y2 receptor and PI(4,5)P2 on ENaC regulation.

BACKGROUND: Many risk factors can contribute to the occurrence of Alzheimer`s 
Disease (AD). However, little is known about the impact of dementia risk factors 
to the uptake of tau-PET tracers. Therefore, in this work we aim to investigate 
the influence of dementia risk factors and comorbidities on 18F-Flortaucipir 
(FTP) and 18F-MK6240 (MK) tau-PET tracers' uptake. Additionally, we will assess 
how these factors impact the association of tau-PET and cognition.
METHOD: We accessed 436 individuals across the aging and AD spectrum (251 
amyloid negative and 185 amyloid positive) from the HEAD study, with available 
Aβ-PET, FTP, MK, and clinical assessments. Linear regression models corrected 
for age, sex, clinical diagnosis, and study site tested the association of 
factors with tau-PET tracers in the medial temporal lobe (MTL). A tau-PET × risk 
factor term was added to test the influence of risk factors to the association 
of tau with cognition.
RESULT: In amyloid-β negative individuals, high BMI were positively associated 
with the uptake of both FTP and MK, whereas hearing loss were positively 
associated only with MK in the MTL (Figure 1A). In amyloid-β positive 
individuals, high body mass index (BMI), hearing loss and sleep disorders were 
negatively associated with the uptake of both tau-PET tracers in the MTL. On the 
other hand, hypertension showed negative association only with MK uptake (Figure 
1B). Using Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores as outcome, we observed 
that amyloid-β negative individuals with high BMI showed worse cognitive 
performance as a function of both MK and FTP in the MTL, whereas individuals 
with vision impairment and hearing loss showed worse cognitive performance as a 
function of MK only (Figure 2A). Amyloid-β positive individuals with 
hypercholesterolemia and hypertension presented worse cognitive performance as a 
function of both MK and FTP in the MTL (Figure 2B).
CONCLUSION: In this preliminary analysis, sleep disorders, hypertension, and 
high BMI were independently associated with tau-PET tracer uptake, with the 
effects varying according to amyloid-β pathology. These prevalent factors in the 
elderly also changed the association between tau-PET and cognition, underscoring 
the need for further studies to better understand their role in modulating this 
relationship.

BACKGROUND: Clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH) in chronic liver 
disease (CLD) is a key driver of decompensation, with severe portal hypertension 
(SPH) leading to severe complications like oesophageal bleeding. Early detection 
is essential for timely treatment. The current gold standard for assessing 
portal pressure is hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG), an invasive and 
costly procedure with limited availability. Non-invasive alternatives are 
increasingly needed to estimate portal pressure (e.g. by liver and spleen 
stiffness measurement) and guide treatment. However, the diagnostic accuracy of 
vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE), point shear wave 
elastography (pSWE), two-dimensional shear wave elastography (2D-SWE), and 
magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) remains unknown.
OBJECTIVES: Primary objectives: to assess the diagnostic accuracy of liver 
stiffness measurement (LSM) and spleen stiffness measurement (SSM), as well as 
in combination, measured by any elastography technique (VCTE, pSWE, 2D-SWE, or 
MRE) in the detection of CSPH in adults with CLD; and to compare the diagnostic 
accuracies between the individual tests. We will regard a combination of tests 
as positive when at least one is positive.
SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: to assess the diagnostic accuracy of LSM and SSM, as well 
as in combination, measured by any elastography technique (VCTE, pSWE, 2D-SWE, 
or MRE) in the detection of SPH in adults with CLD; and to investigate sources 
of heterogeneity in the results.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials 
Register, the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Diagnostic Test of Accuracy Studies 
Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE ALL Ovid, Embase Ovid, LILACS, Science Citation Index 
- Expanded (Web of Science), and Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science 
(Web of Science) until 8 April 2024. We applied no restrictions on language or 
document type.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included studies that evaluated the diagnostic accuracy 
of LSM and SSM either alone or in combination, as measured by different 
elastography techniques (VCTE, pSWE, 2D-SWE, or MRE), for the diagnosis of CSPH 
and SPH in adults with CLD. We only considered studies with cross-sectional 
design using HVPG measurement as the reference standard.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently screened studies, 
extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias and applicability concerns using 
the QUADAS-C tool. In the case of different cut-off values, we used the 
hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (HSROC) model to 
meta-analyse data (sensitivities and specificities) and to estimate a summary 
ROC (SROC) curve. In the case of common cut-off values, we used the bivariate 
model. We presented uncertainty of the accuracy estimates using 95% confidence 
intervals (CIs).
MAIN RESULTS: We included 47 studies (7817 participants). The most evaluated 
index test was LSM by VCTE for CSPH (27 studies; 3818 participants). We judged 
only two studies at low risk of bias for all domains. Most showed high risk in 
the index test domain due to lack of prespecified thresholds and high concern 
for applicability in patient selection. Overall, the certainty of evidence was 
very low. Due to varying thresholds across studies, we used an HSROC model to 
obtain summary estimates. The main findings for detecting CSPH are below. LSM by 
VCTE (27 studies, 3818 participants): Sensitivity 72.6% (95% CI 60.0% to 82.5%) 
at fixed specificity of 90% Specificity 75.9% (95% CI 63.5% to 85.1%) at fixed 
sensitivity of 90% SSM by VCTE (6 studies, 391 participants): Sensitivity 72.9% 
(95% CI 27.1% to 95.1%) at fixed specificity of 90% Specificity 80.6% (95% CI 
64.1% to 90.7%) at fixed sensitivity of 90% SSM by pSWE (4 studies, 248 
participants): Sensitivity 84.1% (95% CI 8.4% to 99.7%) at fixed specificity of 
90% Specificity 86.1% (95% CI 40.4% to 98.3%) at fixed sensitivity of 90% LSM by 
2D-SWE (10 studies, 767 participants): Sensitivity 73.5% (95% CI 52.6% to 87.4%) 
at fixed specificity of 90% Specificity 83.4% (95% CI 68.2% to 92.2%) at fixed 
sensitivity of 80% (estimation at 90% not feasible) SSM by 2D-SWE (6 studies, 
353 participants): Sensitivity 80.0% (95% CI 59.8% to 91.5%) at fixed 
specificity of 90% Estimation at fixed sensitivity not feasible HSROC analysis 
was not feasible for LSM by pSWE and LSM or SSM by MRE due to insufficient data. 
For LSM by VCTE at 25 kPa (9 studies, 1553 participants), sensitivity was 62.3% 
(95% CI 53.0% to 70.7%) and specificity 94.1% (95% CI 87.2% to 97.3%). We 
explored heterogeneity and observed a prevalence effect: relative specificity 
0.90 (95% CI 0.83 to 0.97). Other factors could not be assessed. For SPH as 
secondary objective, LSM by VCTE was the most evaluated test (8 studies; 637 
participants). Sensitivity corresponding to specificity of 90% was 67.2% (95% CI 
48.8% to 81.4%), while specificity corresponding to sensitivity of 90% could not 
be calculated by the HSROC model. Direct comparisons between two index tests 
were impossible due to inconsistent numbers of participants included for each 
index test. Due to variability in cut-off values reported across studies, we 
only performed indirect comparisons using SROC curves. Thus, no reliable results 
emerged from comparisons or combinations across techniques.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Liver and spleen stiffness measurements may offer a 
non-invasive alternative to HVPG for detecting CSPH. However, the accuracy of 
individual techniques remains uncertain due to very low-certainty evidence and 
insufficient data for reliable comparisons. No test achieved both sensitivity 
and specificity ≥ 90%, limiting their utility for confidently ruling in or out 
CSPH. For LSM by VCTE, the most commonly studied method, HSROC modelling yielded 
a sensitivity of 72.6% (95% CI 60.0% to 82.5%) at a fixed specificity of 90%, 
based on studies using various thresholds. In a subgroup of nine studies (1553 
participants) using the predefined 25 kPa cut-off, 38% of patients with CSPH 
would be missed, and 6% without CSPH would be incorrectly identified. The 
certainty of the evidence is very low, mainly due to high risk of bias, 
heterogeneity, and imprecision. High-quality research is needed with predefined 
thresholds, standardised methodology, and improved reporting. Future studies 
should target key subpopulations (e.g. compensated CLD, specific aetiologies) 
and assess combinations of non-invasive tools to enhance diagnostic accuracy and 
clinical usefulness.

BACKGROUND: Depressive symptoms are a modifiable risk factor for dementia, yet 
underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Depression is a heterogeneous condition, 
encompassing a wide range of symptoms, and it may be valuable to identify 
specific symptom patterns that are most associated with an increased risk of 
cognitive impairment and blood-based biomarkers. Here, we investigated the 
associations between Visit 1 depressive symptoms and plasma 
Amyloid-Tau-Neurodegeneration-Inflammation or ATN(I) biomarkers 7-years later in 
a diverse cohort of middle-aged and older Hispanic/Latino individuals, a 
population often underrepresented in dementia research.
METHOD: Participants recruited into the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of 
Latinos (HCHS/SOL; Visit 1 conducted between 2008-2011) and its ancillary study, 
Study of Latinos-Investigation of Neurocognitive Aging (SOL-INCA; Visit 2 
conducted between 2015-2018) were screened for somatic, negative affective, and 
anhedonia symptoms of depression at Visit 1 (Center for Epidemiological 
Studies-Depression Scale, CESD-10). Plasma ATN(I) biomarkers included 
beta-amyloid 42/40 (Aβ42/40 ratio, n = 5,536), phosphorylated tau181 (p-tau181, 
n = 5,713), neurofilament light chain (NfL, n = 5,866), and glial fibrillary 
acidic protein (GFAP, n = 5,686) measured at Visit 2 7-years later (Quanterix 
Simoa HD-X Analyzer). Survey-based generalized linear regressions measured 
associations between continuous depressive symptoms (somatic, negative 
affective, and anhedonia subscales, respectively) and plasma ATN(I) biomarkers 
7-years later, adjusting for age, sex, Hispanic/Latino heritage, body mass 
index, APOE status, education, diabetes, cardiovascular disease risk factors 
(smoking, dyslipidemia, hypertension), antidepressant use, and field center.
RESULT: Higher somatic symptoms at Visit 1 were associated with higher ptau-181 
(β= 0.03, 95% CI [-0.05; 0.12]), higher NfL (β= 1.30, CI [-0.52;3.12]), and 
lower GFAP (β= -2.95, CI [-8.36;2.46]) 7-years later, albeit not significantly. 
Higher anhedonia and negative affective symptoms were associated with lower 
ptau-181 (β= -0.05, CI [-0.11;0.01] and β= -0.05, CI [-0.11;0.02], 
respectively), higher NfL (β= 0.02, CI [-0.79;0.83] and β=0.45, CI [-0.78; 1.69] 
respectively), and lower GFAP (β= -2.71, CI [-6.30;0.88] and β= - 2.37, CI 
[-6.49;1.74]).
CONCLUSION: The current work suggests that different depressive symptoms may 
uniquely relate to distinct ATN(I) biomarkers. Future studies will examine the 
potential impact of chronic depressive symptoms as this longitudinal cohort ages 
as well as neurocognitive outcomes, providing a deeper understanding of the 
pathways linking depression to cognitive decline.

BACKGROUND: Right ventricular-pulmonary arterial (RV-PA) uncoupling is central 
to prognosis in precapillary pulmonary hypertension (PH). While the tricuspid 
annular plane systolic excursion tosystolic pulmonary artery pressure 
(TAPSE/sPAP) ratio is an established bedside surrogate of RV-PA coupling, novel 
energetic markers such as three-dimensional (3D)-derived right ventricular (RV) 
global wasted work (GWW) may provide complementary insight into maladaptive RV 
remodeling.
OBJECTIVES: To contextualize the prognostic value of RV GWW relative to 
TAPSE/sPAP and clarify their mechanistic and clinical complementarity.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients with elevated GWW (≥38 mmHg/%) exhibited evidence 
of RV-PA uncoupling, including a reduced RV end-systolic elastance to arterial 
elastance (Ees/Ea) ratio (0.47 [0.34-0.73] vs. 0.71 [0.50-0.91]; p = 0.007) and 
lower TAPSE/sPAP ratio (0.21 [0.18-0.32] vs. 0.34 [0.22- 0.45] mm/Hg; p = 0.003) 
compared with lower GWW. In secondary analyses, a TAPSE/sPAP ratio below the 
median was associated with increased risk of death or lung transplantation 
(hazard ratio [HR] 3.20; 95% CI: 1.45-7.08), remaining significant after 
adjustment for age and sex (adjusted HR 2.97; 95% CI: 1.27-6.94). Discrimination 
was modest and comparable for TAPSE/sPAP (C-statistic 0.63; 95% CI: 0.53-0.73) 
and GWW (C-statistic 0.61), with no significant difference between metrics (ΔC = 
-0.02; p = 0.68).
CONCLUSIONS: TAPSE/sPAP remains a robust and clinically valuable surrogate of 
macroscopic RV-PA coupling. However, GWW offers complementary information by 
quantifying myocardial inefficiency related to paradoxical and postsystolic 
deformation, capturing energetic consequences of afterload mismatch that may not 
be reflected by displacement-based indices alone. Integrating energetic and 
mechanical markers may enable a more granular assessment of RV performance, 
particularly in intermediate-risk PH, and warrants evaluation in larger 
multicenter studies.

Cardiovascular risk factors contribute to the majority of dementia cases, with 
about 20% directly attributable to vascular cognitive impairment and dementia 
(VCID). VCID treatment developments have been slow compared with Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), which now has several FDA-approved symptom- and disease-modifying 
agents. In the second part of this JACC Seminar Series, advances and new 
perspectives on the management and prevention of VCID are reviewed. There is 
reasonable evidence that cognitive enhancers (donepezil, galantamine, and 
memantine) modestly improve cognition in vascular dementia (VaD), the most 
severe form of VCID, especially if there is associated AD pathology. 
Antidepressants may benefit those with depression and stroke, but they have poor 
efficacy in those with depression and VaD alone. Behavioral, social, and 
environmental interventions are first-line therapies for managing 
VCID-associated agitation and psychosis. Second-line antipsychotics have not 
been trialed in those with VaD alone, but are beneficial where AD and VaD 
co-exist, with risperidone and quetiapine effective in reducing psychosis and 
agitation. Primary prevention of VCID includes identifying and managing 
cardiometabolic risk factors along with manifestations of covert cerebrovascular 
disease. Both primary and secondary VCID prevention involve management of 
cardiovascular risks, specifically hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking, 
atrial fibrillation, obesity, and sedentariness. Management of vascular risk 
factors may moderately reduce the risk of incident cognitive impairment. Novel 
interventions currently being evaluated in clinical trials are discussed. The 
discovery and utilization of VCID and AD biomarkers will enhance the specificity 
and effectiveness of interventions such that a precision-medicine approach to 
disease-specific medical therapy may be taken.

Vascular cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID), ie, cognitive impairment 
secondary to cerebrovascular disease (CeVD), is the second most common form of 
dementia after Alzheimer's disease (AD), accounting for 15% to 20% of all cases. 
CeVD, in fact, contributes to dementia alongside other neuropathologies in up to 
75% of dementia cases. CeVD and AD not only frequently co-occur in the brain, 
but they may also interact, and some VCID risk factors (midlife hypertension and 
diabetes) also increase AD risk. Because CeVD and cardiovascular disease share 
risk factors and pathophysiology, the cardiovascular clinician is likely to 
encounter both in the clinic. Moreover, common cardiac disorders, such as atrial 
fibrillation, heart failure, acute coronary syndrome, and valvular disease, 
increase VCID risk. There have been recent developments in the diagnostic 
criteria for VCID, with advances in risk biomarkers, treatment, and prevention 
of cognitive impairment and dementia. The diagnosis of VCID is a 2-step process, 
with the initial identification of a cognitive syndrome followed by the 
establishment of a predominantly vascular etiology, guided by clinical history 
and examination and substantiated by neuroimaging, preferably magnetic resonance 
imaging. Clinical presentations include an acute onset, a stepwise decline, a 
fluctuating course if caused by multiple strokes, or a gradual slow progression 
if attributable to cerebral small vessel disease. Cognitive deficits can be 
found in several domains, such as information-processing speed, attention, 
executive function, and emotional lability, sometimes referred to as the 
subcortical syndrome, often seen in the early stages of VCID without cortical 
infarcts. The diagnosis is supported by the identification of large and small 
infarcts, lacunes, white matter hyperintensities, dilated perivascular spaces 
and cerebral microbleeds using magnetic resonance imaging. This part 1 of a 
2-part JACC review series describes the clinical features, pathophysiology, and 
biomarkers of VCID for cardiovascular clinicians who have a critical role in its 
early identification, management, and prevention in their patients.

BACKGROUND: Cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) is the most common cause of 
vascular cognitive impairment, but its relationship to cognition across the 
neurocognitive spectrum is not fully understood. CSVD burden can be inferred 
from several magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) markers, which can be combined to 
generate a CSVD score. We investigated the association between CSVD score with 
various cognitive measures.
METHOD: Baseline data from 972 participants [Table 1] from the Comprehensive 
Assessment of Neurodegeneration and Dementia (COMPASS-ND) study were analyzed 
[11.9% cognitively unimpaired [CU], 14.7% subjective cognitive decline [SCD], 
36.4% mild cognitive impairment [MCI], 36.9% dementia). Brain MRI scans were 
visually rated for Standards for Reporting Vascular Changes on Neuroimaging 
(STRIVE)-based evidence of vascular brain injury (lacunes, microbleeds, white 
matter hyperintensities [WMH], cortical superficial siderosis [cSS], enlarged 
perivascular spaces [EPVS]). Three CSVD scores corresponding to global, cerebral 
amyloid angiopathy (CAA-CSVD)-specific, and hypertensive arteriopathy 
(HTNA-CSVD)-specific CSVD burden were generated [Table 2]. Cognitive measures 
included the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Clinical Dementia Rating sum 
of boxes (CDR-SB), and a composite neuropsychological battery test z-score. We 
modelled CSVD score (exposure) associations with five outcomes: Hachinski 
ischemic score (negative binomial regression), MoCA total score (linear 
regression), CDR-SB (median quantile regression), and neuropsychological battery 
composite z-score (linear regression), cognitive diagnosis (ordinal logistic 
regression). Covariates included age, sex, and education.
RESULT: Global, CAA- and HTNA-CSVD scores were all associated with greater 
Hachinski ischemic score, poorer MoCA score, higher CDR-SB, and poorer composite 
neuropsychological battery test z-score [Table 3]. Both global CSVD score 
(adjusted odds ratio [aOR]=1.14, 95%CI: [1.02, 1.26], p = .02) and HTNA-CSVD 
score (aOR=1.18, 95%CI: [1.04, 1.35], p = .01) were associated with higher odds 
of a more severe cognitive diagnosis compared to a less severe cognitive 
diagnosis (e.g., dementia vs MCI/SCD/CU), but not CAA-CSVD score (aOR=1.09, 
95%CI: [0.97, 1.24], p = .15).
CONCLUSION: Older adults with greater CSVD burden, as evidenced by multiple MRI 
markers, exhibit poorer cognition and functional performance across the 
neurocognitive continuum. Notably, these associations were observed not only for 
global CSVD but also for both CAA- and HTNA-specific CSVD scores, suggesting the 
importance of evaluating these specific pathologies when assessing 
cerebrovascular contributions to cognitive decline.

BACKGROUND: Neuroticism, a personality trait characterized by a tendency to 
experience negative emotions, has been associated with cognitive decline and an 
increased risk of dementia. Examining its association with structural brain 
changes and mediators may highlight underlying biological mechanisms and 
potential intervention targets for at-risk individuals.
METHOD: We included 36,901 dementia-free UK Biobank participants (mean [SD] age 
64.4 [7.7] years). The associations between neuroticism and 1,747 structural MRI 
metrics were assessed using multiple linear regression, adjusted for 
sociodemographic, lifestyle, and imaging-related confounders. The MRI metrics 
included cortical and subcortical volumes, surface area, thickness, intensities, 
ventricular/CSF volumes, and white matter macro- and microstructure. 
Bonferroni-significant associations underwent bidirectional two-sample Mendelian 
randomization (MR) to evaluate the evidence for a causal relationship. Causal 
mediation analyses were performed to assess whether a history of depression, 
anxiety, hypertension, ischemic heart disease (IHD), and diabetes mediated 
Bonferroni-significant observational associations. These conditions were 
selected based on prior MR studies showing unidirectional causal effects of 
neuroticism on their risk, with diabetes included as a negative control due to 
its weak association with neuroticism.
RESULT: Neuroticism was associated with reduced cortical volume and surface 
area, particularly in the frontal and limbic regions. Bonferroni-significant 
associations were observed between neuroticism and lower volumes of medial 
frontal, subcallosal, medial orbitofrontal, and anterior cingulate cortex. 
Neuroticism was also associated with widespread differences in white matter 
microstructure, with the strongest associations observed in the thalamic 
radiations. For example, lower fractional anisotropy, higher diffusivity, and 
lower intracellular volume fraction were identified in the posterior thalamic 
radiations (all Bonferroni-significant). MR analyses supported genetic 
associations between neuroticism and a reduced anterior cingulate cortex surface 
area. Hypertension mediated neuroticism's associations with cortical and white 
matter structures, while depression and anxiety mainly mediated white matter 
microstructure associations (up to 30%). Contributions from IHD and diabetes 
were minimal.
CONCLUSION: Neuroticism was associated with widespread structural differences, 
including lower volumes in frontal and limbic regions and impaired 
microstructure in the thalamic radiations, partially mediated by mental and 
vascular conditions. Further research is needed to strengthen evidence of 
causality in these pathways and explore their roles in cognitive decline and 
dementia.

PURPOSE: To investigate the incidence and risk factors for steroid-induced 
ocular hypertension (SI-OHT) in patients receiving intravitreal steroids for 
retinal inflammatory diseases.
METHODS: This retrospective observational study included patients who received 
either intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide (IVTA/TA group) or dexamethasone 
intravitreal implant (DEX group) for the management of retinal vascular diseases 
in the period of 2018-23. SI-OHT in those patients were followed up for 2 years. 
Steroid responders and nonresponders were characterized based on intraocular 
pressure (IOP) change from the baseline. The incidence, risk factors, and 
magnitude of IOP rise and its association with ocular and systemic illness were 
investigated.
RESULTS: Out of 1178 reviewed, 761 patients were excluded due to irregular 
follow-up. A total of 382 patients (382 eyes) who received either IVTA/DEX 
intravitreal implant during the study period were reviewed. The incidence of 
SI-OHT was found to be 46.3% (IVTA group) and 20.8% (DEX group) at 6 months, 
respectively. Among patients who received 2 mg IVTA dosage, 16.9% were steroid 
responders and 11.9% for the 4 mg group.
CONCLUSION: We found that the incidence of SI-OHT was higher in IVTA group as 
compared to DEX group. No dose-dependent incidence was observed in the case of 
IVTA group. Age, gender, number of injections, and myopia were not associated 
with the risk of SI-OHT. Renal disease showed a significant association with the 
risk of SI-OHT in the DEX group, and patients with TB, stroke, and other drug 
allergies experienced a fivefold greater increase in IOP values in those groups.

Comparison of virtual reality-based portable perimetry and conventional 
perimetry in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension.

Author information:

Tatvan State Hospital, Bitlis, Turkey.

Turkey.

PURPOSE: To compare a newly developed virtual reality-based perimeter (Oculera 
visual field analyzer) with the Humphrey Field Analyzer (HFA) in patients with 
idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH).
DESIGN: A cross-sectional study.
METHODS: In this study, 30 eyes of 15 IIH patients were randomly tested with HFA 
(24-2, SITA Standard) and Oculera (24-2, Oculera Interactive) on the same visit. 
Test durations, global indices [visual field index (VFI), mean deviation (MD), 
and pattern standard deviation (PSD)], and false negative and positive user 
responses were compared. Spearman correlation was used for statistical analysis.
RESULTS: Correlation analysis showed a statistically significant correlation 
between the measurements of the two devices in terms of the global indices (VFI, 
MD, and PSD) and test duration (r = 0.361, P = 0.050; r = 0.395, P = 0.031; r = 
0.408, P = 0.025; and r = 0.363, P = 0.049, respectively). The Oculera was 
within an acceptable range for 83.3% of eyes, considering the MD reproducibility 
of 1.5-4 dB for HFA. No significant difference was found between the devices in 
false positive and negative responses (P = 0.098 and P = 0.395, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Standard automated perimetry is the gold standard for detecting 
visual field defects, but it is costly and requires prolonged attention and 
stable fixation. The results of the Oculera, produced with virtual reality 
technology, were found to be consistent with those of the HFA, and its much 
lower cost and portability suggest that it has the potential to be an 
alternative to conventional perimeters.

BACKGROUND: Preeclampsia is a hypertensive disorder affecting 2% to 8% of 
pregnancies. Women with a history of preeclampsia have an increased risk of 
cardiovascular disease. The long noncoding RNA MALAT1 is shown to regulate 
inflammatory responses linked to cardiovascular disease. MALAT1 is decreased in 
preeclampsia placentas and may have a cis-regulatory function on neighboring 
RNAs.
METHODS: Expression of MALAT1, NEAT1, mascRNA, SCYL1, and FRMD8 was assessed in 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and MALAT1 in plasma and extracellular 
vesicles, at 22 to 24 and 36 to 38 weeks of gestation in healthy (n=214) and 
preeclampsia (n=37) women from the STORK cohort study and at 5-year follow-up in 
women with and without history of preeclampsia (n=29; n=271). We investigated 
their associations with established markers of disease activity and later 
cardiometabolic risk. MALAT1 was silenced in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated THP-1 
differentiated macrophages in vitro.
RESULTS: MALAT1, NEAT1, mascRNA, and FRMD8 are decreased in peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells during preeclampsia development. At follow-up in women with a 
previous preeclampsia diagnosis, MALAT1 and NEAT1 are decreased in peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells and show associations with cardiometabolic markers. 
Silencing MALAT1 in macrophages increased secretion of IL (interleukin)-6 and 
reduced MMP9 (matrix metalloproteinase-9) and VEGF (vascular endothelial growth 
factor) A levels.
CONCLUSIONS: Given the association of MALAT1 and neighboring RNAs with 
preeclampsia during pregnancy and at follow-up, as well as with cardiometabolic 
markers and results from silencing experiments, these transcripts may be 
potential targets for preeclampsia development and cardiometabolic risk in women 
with previous preeclampsia.

BACKGROUND: The health benefits of different moderate-to-vigorous physical 
activity (MVPA) patterns, including weekend warrior and regularly distributed 
activity, in individuals with hypertension remain unclear. This study 
investigated associations between MVPA patterns and mortality and stroke 
outcomes in patients with hypertension.
METHODS: A total of 52 838 participants from the UK Biobank with accelerometer 
data following hypertension were included. Participants were classified by 
weekly MVPA amounts and distribution: active weekend warrior, active regular, 
and inactive. Cox proportional hazards models examined associations between MVPA 
patterns and all-cause mortality, with secondary outcomes including stroke 
mortality, stroke, and ischemic stroke.
RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 7.5 years, 2636 all-cause mortality, 161 
stroke mortality, 875 stroke, and 716 ischemic stroke events occurred. Compared 
with the inactive group, both active weekend warriors (hazard ratio [HR], 0.70 
[95% CI, 0.64-0.77]; P<0.0001) and active regular (HR, 0.73 [95% CI, 
0.65-0.82];P<0.0001) demonstrated ≈30% lower risk of all-cause mortality. Both 
active groups showed risk reduction trends for stroke mortality (active weekend 
warrior: HR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.59-1.22]; active regular: HR, 0.87 [95% CI, 
0.55-1.38]), stroke (HR, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.73-1.00] versus HR, 0.91 [95% CI, 
0.75-1.10]), and ischemic stroke (HR, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.70-0.99] versus HR, 0.87 
[95% CI, 0.70-1.08]), though these were not statistically significant.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings underscore the health benefits of actively engaging in 
guideline-recommended MVPA for patients with hypertension, demonstrating a 30% 
mortality risk reduction whether they distribute MVPA throughout the week or 
concentrate MVPA within 1 to 2 days compared with physical inactivity.

BACKGROUND: Sympathetic activation plays a role in heart failure (HF) 
development. Afferent renal nerve input may induce sympathoexcitation via the 
hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN), which projects to the rostral 
ventrolateral medulla, a center for sympathetic regulation. Central dendritic 
release of vasopressin from PVN neurons reportedly stimulates neighboring 
presympathetic neurons, causing sympathoexcitation. This study investigated 
whether afferent renal nerves contribute to hypertensive cardiac dysfunction and 
whether the afferent renal nerve-PVN axis mediates sympathoexcitation via 
central vasopressin using salt-loaded Dahl salt-sensitive rats, a model of 
hypertensive HF.
METHODS: Salt loading began at 6 weeks of age, with selective afferent renal 
denervation and total renal denervation performed at 9 weeks in Dahl 
salt-sensitive rats. HF phenotypes were examined at 16 weeks, while 
sympathomodulation by afferent renal denervation was assessed at 12 weeks, the 
pre-HF phase.
RESULTS: At 16 weeks, afferent renal denervation and total renal denervation 
similarly improved left ventricular systolic dysfunction, reduced myocardial 
fibrosis and related mRNA levels, and lowered plasma norepinephrine levels 
without reducing blood pressure in hypertensive rats. At 12 weeks, afferent 
renal denervation attenuated the increase in plasma norepinephrine and 
presympathetic neuron activity in the PVN and rostral ventrolateral medulla in 
hypertensive rats, while decreasing vasopressin-producing PVN neuron activity. 
In acute experiments, afferent renal nerve stimulation increased sympathetic 
outflow, but vasopressin V1a and V1b receptor blockade in the PVN suppressed 
this sympathoexcitation in hypertensive rats.
CONCLUSIONS: Afferent renal nerve input activates the sympathetic nervous system 
before left ventricular systolic dysfunction and contributes to hypertensive HF, 
with PVN vasopressin driving this sympathoexcitation.

BACKGROUND: Perivascular macrophages play a significant role in the pathogenesis 
of hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension via crosstalk to pulmonary artery 
smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) to stimulate their proliferation and pulmonary 
vascular remodeling. However, whether hypoxia exposure of macrophages affects 
cellular crosstalk remains entirely unclear. This study aimed to decipher the 
effects of hypoxia on macrophages' crosstalk to PASMCs and elucidate the 
underlying molecular mechanisms.
METHODS: Conditioned medium obtained from bone marrow-derived macrophages under 
normoxia or hypoxia was transferred for hypoxic culture of primary mouse PASMCs, 
followed by RNA sequencing analysis. Myeloid-specific SerpinB1-overexpressing 
mice were generated to explore SerpinB1's role in macrophage inflammatory 
phenotype, PASMC proliferation, and pulmonary vascular remodeling.
RESULTS: Hypoxia-exposure of macrophages produced a conspicuous augmentation to 
the pro-proliferative effect of the conditioned medium on PASMCs. Hypoxia 
exposure aggravated macrophage inflammatory phenotype, as indicated by marked 
enrichment of multiple inflammatory pathways and elevated levels of inflammatory 
cytokines. SerpinB1 (serpin family B member 1) was identified as the key 
downstream mediator of hypoxia to regulate macrophage inflammatory phenotype 
because hypoxia induced its drastic downregulation and subsequent NLRP3 (NOD 
[nucleotide oligomerization domain]-, LRR [leucine-rich repeat]-, and PYD [pyrin 
domain]-containing protein 3)-independent inflammatory caspase-1 activation. 
Myeloid-specific overexpression of SerpinB1 largely blunted hypoxia-induced 
macrophage inflammatory phenotype and amplified the pro-proliferative effect on 
PASMCs. Myeloid SerpinB1-overexpressing mice exhibited lower right ventricular 
systolic pressure, milder right ventricular hypertrophy, and pulmonary vascular 
remodeling after chronic hypoxia exposure.
CONCLUSIONS: Hypoxia exposure directly amplifies the pro-proliferative crosstalk 
of macrophages to PASMCs via downregulating SerpinB1 to induce caspase-1 
activation and inflammatory phenotype. Targeting macrophage SerpinB1 may hold 
promise for treating pulmonary hypertension.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of comorbidities and lifestyle factors on the 
prognostic value of preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) for 
tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) staging in Chinese patients with colorectal cancer 
(CRC).
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of 307 patients with CRC from Beijing Luhe 
Hospital (2020-2024) was performed. Clinicopathological data, including TNM and 
Numerical staging (AJCC 8th edition), serum CEA levels, and covariates 
(comorbidities and lifestyle factors), were analyzed using univariate and 
multivariate logistic regression. Multivariable logistic regression with 
multiplicative interaction terms (CEA × modifier) was used to test for effect 
modification.
RESULTS: Elevated CEA levels were significantly associated with advanced TNM 
staging (Stage III-IV vs stage I-II, p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis confirmed 
that CEA was an independent predictor of T stage progression (HR = 1.15, p= 
0.017), lymph node metastasis (N stage: HR = 1.17, p = 0.046), and distant 
metastasis (M stage: HR = 1.06, p = 0.018). Formal interaction analysis revealed 
that alcohol use significantly amplified the CEA-stage association (HR = 3.11, 
95% CI 1.11-8.74, p = 0.031), whereas coronary heart disease attenuated the 
relationship (HR = 0.40, 95% CI 0.18-0.87, p = 0.022), yielding a paradoxical 
inverse association in affected patients. In addition, hypertension nullified 
the predictive utility of CEA, with a significant stage association observed 
only in the nonhypertensive subgroup.
CONCLUSION: Preoperative CEA exhibits robust predictive accuracy for TNM staging 
in Chinese patients with colorectal cancer; however, this performance is 
critically modulated by alcohol use, coronary heart disease, and hypertension. 
Systematic incorporation of these three effect modifiers into preoperative 
risk-stratification algorithms will refine staging accuracy and enable 
patient-tailored therapeutic strategies.

Unhealthy diet and hypertension constitute major risk factors for the 
development of cardiometabolic diseases. However, the direct effects of dietary 
components and high blood pressure on metabolic profiles remain poorly 
understood. We evaluated concentrations of amino acids and nutrients in the 
plasma and tissues of animal models subjected to high-fat and high-disaccharide 
diet without excessive caloric intake, in salt-resistant rats on high salt 
intake, in spontaneously hypertensive rats, and in angiotensin II-induced 
hypertensive rats. Using liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry, we 
identified changes in several analytes across models. We found that a high-fat 
diet increased tissue levels of methylglycines (betaine, sarcosine) and glycine, 
while high salt intake and hypertension were associated with a distinct 
reduction of methyl/glycine species and the accumulation of taurine in the 
tissues. We further observed tissue-specific alterations. For instance, alanine 
was decreased in the kidneys of rats on high salt and in hypertensive models. 
Beta-alanine was higher in the lung and renal cortex of rats on high salt, but 
lower in the cardiovascular system of hypertensive models. A high-sugar diet 
increased circulating levels of betaine and taurine, although its impact on 
tissues was less pronounced. In conclusion, this study provides a comprehensive 
evaluation of organic solutes in different animal models and highlights the 
diverse metabolic alterations associated with diet and hypertension. Further 
research is required to explore the significance of these findings and their 
potential implications for understanding disease mechanisms.

OBJECTION: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) was a cancer-like disease. It 
shared several mechanisms, including perivascular inflammation. But the genes 
common and different between cancer and PAH was still unclear. We aimed to 
analyze the genes common in the two diseases, especially the N7-methylguanosine 
(m7G) genes.
METHODS: We acquired dataset GSE1519, GSE113439, and GSE81089 and recognized 
differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and investigated their functions utilizing 
R software. m7G-related genes were identified using a online tool RMvar. The 
extent of immune cell infiltration in the normal and PAH tissues, nonsmall cell 
lung cancer (NSCLC) tissues was determined using ImmuneCellAI and CIBERSORT. 
Additionally, the association between diagnostic markers and immune cells was 
analyzed. Single cell analysis and Cellchat were used to analyze the role of 
SPP1 in the PAH.
RESULTS: Among five DEGs overlapped by the differently datasets about NSCLC, 
CD163, and SPP1 were m7G genes. The immune cell infiltration results suggested 
that PAH and NSCLC shared different immune cell infiltration. SPP1 was 
significantly correlated to the macrophage cells and activated mast cells in 
NSCLC. Higher expression of CD163 and SPP1 might be related to the progression 
of monocrotaline (MCT) induced rats in the dataset GSE229361. The KM survival 
analysis suggested that higher expression of CD163 and SPP1 related to poor 
prognosis of NSCLC. The important role of SPP1 in PAH was verified using single 
cell anslysis.
CONCLUSION: Different T cells infiltration contributed to the development of PAH 
and NSCLC. SPP1 might be vital for the cancer-like characteristics of PAH.

Sudan.

OBJECTIVES: Whereas about 20% of emergency medical admissions in richer 
countries are neurological, the situation in poorer countries is less clear. To 
help clarify this we studied admissions data in a hospital in Nyala, Sudan and 
compared our findings with the results from a previous, methodologically similar 
study from Northern Ireland (NI).
METHODS: Over three months the numbers of emergency medical admissions to Nyala 
Teaching Hospital were recorded, along with the percentage with neurological 
symptoms. The following information was also noted: diagnosis, mortality, the 
use of investigations, and referral to neurologists and neurosurgeons. The 
results were compared to a study from the Downe Hospital, NI carried out in 
1987.
RESULTS: Fifty-six (24%) of 234 medical admissions were neurological. Stroke 
(57%), infections (21%) and tumours (11%) made up 89% of neurological 
admissions, with epilepsy accounting for only 4%, a pattern quite different from 
the NI study. Mortality was 23% compared with 12% in the NI study. Referral to 
neurospecialists was similar.
CONCLUSION: Although emergency neurological admissions were slightly commoner, 
the most striking difference between Nyala and the NI study was the high 
proportion of stroke admissions in Nyala to the near exclusion of other 
neurological conditions. The first priority to improving neurological care in 
Nyala, (and by implication, sub-Saharan Africa), is a stroke prevention program.

Introduction The prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) continues to rise 
worldwide. Patients with CKD are exposed to increased risks of end-stage kidney 
disease, cardiovascular events, and mortality. Despite recent pharmacological 
advances, therapeutic options for CKD remain limited. Shichimotsukokato (SCMKT), 
a representative Kampo formula in Japanese Traditional Medicine composed of 
seven crude drugs, has historically been used to treat CKD. Experimental studies 
have demonstrated its renoprotective and antihypertensive effects. However, the 
clinical evidence of SCMKT for CKD patients remains limited. To evaluate the 
effectiveness of the long-term SCMKT administration on renal function, 
proteinuria, and blood pressure in patients with CKD, we conducted a 
retrospective, single-arm, observational study. Methods This study 
targeted outpatients with CKD who were treated with SCMKT. The study was 
conducted at Fukushima Medical University Aizu Medical Center and Tenjinbashi 
Clinic from April 2019 to May 2025 (UMIN000058358). Eligible patients were aged 
≥18 years, had been prescribed SCMKT continuously for one year, and had 
available estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) data from one year before 
initiation, at initiation, and one year after the initiation of SCMKT. The 
primary endpoint was the change in the eGFR slope between the pre-treatment and 
post-treatment periods. The pre-treatment eGFR slope was determined from one 
year before the initiation of SCMKT, and the post-treatment slope from 
initiation to one year after. The eGFR slope was calculated using the 
least-squares regression method. Secondary endpoints included changes in 
systolic and diastolic blood pressure, qualitative proteinuria, and the 
occurrence of adverse events. Results A total of 21 patients who were prescribed 
SCMKT were screened from both institutions. Finally, 12 patients were included 
in our study (mean age, 77.8 years; male, seven patients (58.3%)). The mean 
baseline eGFR was 38.7 ± 10.0 mL/min/1.73 m², and 9 patients (75.0 %) were 
classified as CKD stage G3b. Hypertensive nephrosclerosis was the most common 
primary cause of CKD. There were 11 patients (91.7 %) with concomitant 
hypertension, and 9 patients (75.0 %) were prescribed 
renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors. The mean daily dose of 
SCMKT (Tsumura & Co., Tokyo, Japan) was 5.6 g. The mean eGFR slope significantly 
improved after SCMKT administration compared with the pre-treatment period 
(pre-treatment vs. post-treatment, -4.9 ± 7.3 vs. 5.4 ± 5.4 mL/min/1.73 m²/year; 
P = 0.002). In contrast, there were no significant changes in systolic or 
diastolic blood pressure (132.9 ± 15.5 vs. 135.2 ± 13.4 mmHg; 70.2 ± 13.2 vs. 
73.1 ± 7.5 mmHg, respectively), and qualitative urine protein did not show a 
marked change. No clinical information on serious adverse events that were 
potentially associated with SCMKT was available. Sensitivity analyses excluding 
patients with changes in RAAS inhibitor therapy confirmed the robustness of our 
findings. Conclusions The one-year prescription of SCMKT was safe and may help 
preserve the eGFR slope in patients with CKD. Further prospective studies are 
warranted to confirm the renoprotective effects of SCMKT.

BACKGROUND: Ropivacaine's stereoselective and lipophilic properties contribute 
to its cardiovascular stability and promote the early recovery of sensory and 
motor function, facilitating quicker ambulation and discharge. This study aimed 
to compare the hemodynamic stability measured by blood pressure and heart rate 
changes of intrathecal 0.75% ropivacaine versus 0.5% bupivacaine in patients 
with controlled hypertension undergoing spinal anaesthesia.
METHODS: Eighty patients classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists 
(ASA) physical status II and III with controlled hypertension were randomly 
assigned to either Group R (ropivacaine 0.75%, 3 mL) or Group B (bupivacaine 
0.5%, 3 mL). The onset and duration of sensory and motor blockade were recorded, 
along with incidences of hypotension and bradycardia. Hemodynamic parameters and 
side effects were monitored at preset intervals during the procedure.
RESULTS: The incidence of hypotension was significantly higher in Group B 
compared to Group R (p<0.001), while bradycardia was more frequent in Group B 
but without statistical significance. Motor block duration was 130±30.42 minutes 
for ropivacaine versus 172±20.80 minutes for bupivacaine; sensory block lasted 
160±30.42 minutes and 260±20.40 minutes, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Hyperbaric ropivacaine 0.75% provides superior spinal anaesthesia in 
hypertensive patients, with faster sensory and motor recovery (p<0.001), 
facilitating earlier ambulation and discharge. It also offers enhanced 
hemodynamic stability compared to equipotent hyperbaric bupivacaine 0.5%.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: American Indians have a high population risk for 
cerebrovascular disease, vascular brain injury (VBI), and dementia. The 
apolipoprotein (APOE) ε4 allele is a strong risk factor for Alzheimer's disease 
but is also associated with white matter hyperintensities (WMH) and VBI. 
However, these association have not been thoroughly examined in the American 
Indian population. Our objective was to determine whether APOE ε4 carriers 
exhibited greater longitudinal changes in WMH or if the previously reported null 
effect from cross-sectional findings extended over time in American Indians.
METHODS: We analyzed data from a population-based, longitudinal cohort of 
American Indians aged 64-95 years from the Strong Heart Study recruited from 
Northern Plains, Southern Plains, and Southwest regions. Magnetic resonance 
imaging markers included infarcts, lacunes, hemorrhages, and WMH. APOE genotype 
was determined through serum analysis and dichotomized based on the presence of 
the ε4 allele. Covariates included age, sex, education, hypertension, diabetes, 
stroke history, body mass index, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and study 
site. We used Poisson regression for binary VBI outcomes, linear mixed-effects 
models to assess longitudinal WMH changes, and Cox regression to analyze 
incident VBI.
RESULTS: The sample size was 395 participants with a mean age of 71.3 (4.7) 
years and was comprised of 313 non-ε4-carriers and 82 ε4-carriers, predominantly 
female (70.1%). Cross-sectional analyses indicated no significant associations 
between APOE ε4 and lacunes (RR=1.03, 95% CI: 0.42-2.57), infarcts (RR =1.28, 
95% CI: 0.81-2.02), or hemorrhages (RR = 1.73, 95% CI: 0.60-4.99). Longitudinal 
analyses revealed no significant associations between APOE ε4 and changes in WMH 
volume (β = 0.00, 95% CI: -0.02-0.03). APOE ε4 was not associated with overall 
VBI incidence in fully adjusted models (HR = 2.84, 95% CI: 0.17-48.59).
DISCUSSION: Our findings echo previous work that APOE e4 does not appear to have 
specificity as a risk factor WMH in American Indians. Further research in a 
larger sample size and as well as how modifiable environmental factors might 
modify the biological effects of APOE ε4 on brain aging in American Indians is 
required to validate these findings.

BACKGROUND: The six-minute walk test (6MWT) allows to determine, in addition to 
the main parameters, the time of heart rate recovery (THRR), cardiac function, 
adaptation index (AI), which characterize the compensatory reserve of patients 
with chronic heart failure (CHF). At the same time, the significance of these 
parameters in patients taking beta-blockers for CHF is insufficiently studied, 
taking into account the negative chronotropic effect of drugs. In this regard, 
it is relevant to identify factors that can characterize the compensatory 
capabilities of a patient with CHF during 6MWT, not related to the calculation 
of heart rate.
AIM: To identify hemodynamic indicators of the adaptive capabilities of patients 
with CHF during paired 6MWT depending on their intake of beta-blockers.
METHODS: Seventy-four patients with compensated CHF due to coronary heart 
disease and/or hypertension formed the main group, comprising 46 individuals who 
were taking beta-blockers, and a comparison group comprising 28 individuals who 
had not been taking beta-blockers for at least one month before 6MWT. All 
participants underwent Doppler echocardiography (DECG), paired 6MWT, with 
assessment of hemodynamic parameters before and after both the first and second 
test. AI, THRR, blood pressure variability (BPV) were calculated. Multivariate, 
correlation analyses, univariate analysis of variance were used.
RESULTS: There were no significant associations between adaptation 
characteristics and DECG parameters or functional class (FC) of CHF in patients 
of the main group. In the comparison group, the indicators of compensatory 
reserve were significantly and directly associated with left ventricular 
ejection fraction (LVEF), and inversely with FC CHF and cardiac cavity size. In 
both groups, a greater difference in systolic blood pressure between the end of 
the first and the beginning of the second 6MWT was significantly associated with 
a higher index of right ventricular systolic dysfunction (Tricuspid annular 
plane systolic excursion) and LVEF, as well as a smaller left ventricular size 
and mass, and a lower pulmonary artery systolic pressure in patients in the main 
group.
CONCLUSION: Systolic BPV, measured immediately after 6MWT and 20 minutes after 
its completion, can indirectly characterize the compensatory reserve in patients 
with CHF, regardless of their beta-blocker intake.

BMP9-mediated regulation of endothelin-1 requires integrated SMAD1/5 and SMAD2/3 
signaling.

Bagarova J, Sangam S, Troncone L, Zhong Y, Worst LC, Gipson GR, Nikolic I,

BMP9 is a pleiotropic growth factor cytokine with diverse roles in vascular 
development, homeostasis and disease. BMP9 regulates a broad array of vasoactive 
molecules that mediate endothelial and mural cell function, including ET-1, a 
potent vasoconstrictor, regulator of cell growth and fibrosis, and therapeutic 
target for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Consistent with its 
pleiotropic activities, BMP9 is unique in being able to recruit both 
BMP-responsive SMAD1/5/9 and TGFβ-responsive SMAD2/3 signaling effectors in 
endothelial cells, however, the physiologic significance of activating both 
pathways remains incompletely defined. We investigated the role of SMAD1/5/9 vs. 
SMAD2/3 signaling in BMP9-mediated regulation of ET-1, using primary and 
immortalized human and murine microvascular endothelial cells, with conditional 
knockout, small molecule inhibitor and siRNA strategies. BMP9-mediated 
expression of ET-1 requires coordinated activation of SMAD1/5/9 and SMAD2/3 
effector pathways, both downstream of BMPR2, ALK1, and ENG. Analysis of the ET-1 
promoter revealed that BMP9 requires, in addition to a SMAD3/4 binding site 
sufficient for TGFβ1-mediated transcription, a novel putative SMAD1/5 binding 
motif. BMP9-mediated regulation of endothelial ET-1 requires coordinated 
activation of both SMAD1/5 and SMAD2/3 downstream of ALK1, integrated at the 
promoter level, representing a non-canonical signaling motif linking BMP9 to a 
critical effector of vascular tone and remodeling in PAH and related vascular 
syndromes.
TRANSLATIONAL PERSPECTIVE: BMP9 has recently emerged as a novel therapeutic 
target with an ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial testing an anti-BMP9 antibody for 
efficacy in PAH ( NCT06137742 ). The mechanisms by which BMP9 contributes to 
pulmonary vascular disease are thought to include its regulation of Endothelin-1 
(ET-1), an established therapeutic target in PAH. We show that BMP9 potently 
regulates ET-1 transcription via transactivation of TGFβ1 effector SMAD3 via BMP 
receptors BMPR2 and ALK1, suggesting that pleiotropic effects of this growth 
factor cytokine result from non-canonical activation of BMP and TGFβ signaling 
pathways, with implications for its roles in physiology, and the rationale for 
its therapeutic modulation for PAH.

APOL1 G1 and G2 risk alleles modulate severity of diet-induced obesity in a 
transgenic mouse model.

Kearney AO, Yang JY, Liu E, Wright M, Chen M, Kong J, Barish G, Thorp EB, Lin J.

APOL1 G1 and G2 risk alleles are associated with an increased risk of chronic 
kidney disease. However, a causal relationship between these alleles and 
cardiometabolic traits has not been experimentally validated. To address this 
gap, we placed transgenic APOL1 G0, G1, and G2 FVB/NJ mice on a high-fat diet 
and analyzed them for weight gain as well as obesity-related cardiometabolic 
phenotypes. To test whether APOL1 risk alleles modulate the inflammatory basis 
of obesity, we also exposed bone marrow derived macrophages from these mice to 
pro-inflammatory, pro-hypertensive, and dyslipidemic conditions. APOL1 high-risk 
allele female mice gained fat mass more readily than their low-risk female 
counterparts, while APOL1 high-risk male mice gained fat mass less readily than 
low-risk males. A parallel sex difference was seen in expression of higher 
levels of Abca1 , Hmox1 , and Srebf1 in lipid-loaded female bone-marrow derived 
macrophages expressing G1 and G2 APOL1, along with minor differences in cardiac 
function. However, this finding occurred independently of hypertension and 
insulin resistance, and with only minor albuminuria. Thus, our results highlight 
the importance of sex as a biological variable in future APOL1 experiments.

BACKGROUND: In rural KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa, less than 25 % of 
persons with hypertension have controlled blood pressure. We conducted a 
formative evaluation of current clinic-based care to identify barriers and 
facilitators that could impact effective implementation of a community-based 
hypertension intervention (IMPACT-BP).
METHODS: We conducted individual interviews and group discussions with clinic 
managers, nurses, community health workers (CHWs), community leaders, and 
patients to identify barriers and facilitators experienced in clinic-based 
hypertension care, which could affect the acceptability, feasibility, and 
implementation of the IMPACT-BP intervention. The Conceptual Model of 
Implementation Research and the Theoretical Framework of Acceptability guided 
the design of data collection instruments and analysis. Qualitative data 
collection was performed by trained social science research assistants, 
recorded, transcribed, translated, and analyzed using thematic analysis.
RESULTS: Forty-one participants (92 % women) participated in group discussions 
(n = 32) or individual interviews (n = 9). Barriers to intervention 
acceptability and feasibility included inadequate levels of staffing, high 
patient volumes, distrust of CHWs' work at clinics and in the community, and 
insufficient training and equipment for CHWs. Facilitators included home 
delivery of medications by CHWs.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings allowed us to identify specific adaptations to the 
intervention implementation strategy to make the proposed community-based 
intervention acceptable and feasible in this setting. Adaptations included 
employing dedicated CHWs and nurses for trial-related activities, developing an 
expanded CHW training module on hypertension knowledge, teaching CHWs to measure 
blood pressure and subsequently train patients to do the same, and training CHWs 
to educate patients about hypertension management.

AIM: This study aimed to evaluate the adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes 
among pregnant women with COVID-19 at King Salman Armed Forces Hospital in Tabuk 
and examine the relationship between the severity of COVID-19 infection and 
these outcomes.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study enrolled COVID-19-positive pregnant 
women. Demographic and obstetric information, clinical characteristics 
(including symptoms and preexisting comorbid conditions), and maternal and 
neonatal outcomes were collected from medical records, reviewed, and analyzed.
RESULTS: The study included 138 COVID-19-positive women, with the majority of 
cases diagnosed in the third trimester (85.5%). Assessment of the severity of 
COVID-19 infection showed that a large proportion were asymptomatic (39.1%) or 
had mild disease (39.9%), while 14.5% had moderate disease and 6.5% experienced 
severe illness. Adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes included preeclampsia 
(5.1%), gestational diabetes (4.3%), placental abruption, premature rupture of 
membranes (2.9% each), maternal intensive care unit (ICU) admission (1.4%), 
preterm births (12.3%), low birth weight (15.2%), and neonatal ICU admission 
(10.1%). Additionally, the incidences of preeclampsia and maternal ICU admission 
were significantly higher in women with severe COVID-19 compared to those with 
milder or asymptomatic cases (p = 0.004 each). Neonatal ICU admission showed the 
highest incidence (33.3%) among severe cases (p = 0.031). Asthma was 
significantly linked to a higher risk of neonatal ICU admission (23.1% vs. 
7.1%). Diabetes mellitus was associated with an increased rate of maternal ICU 
admission (13.3% vs. 0%). Hypertension showed significant associations with 
elevated rates of preeclampsia (35.7% vs. 1.6%), maternal ICU admission (14.3% 
vs. 0%), and neonatal ICU admission (35.7% vs. 7.3%).
CONCLUSION: COVID-19 infection during pregnancy was associated with several 
adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes, including preeclampsia, gestational 
diabetes, preterm birth, low birth weight, and increased ICU admissions. Severe 
maternal disease and existing comorbidities further elevated the risks of 
complications for both mother and newborn.

INTRODUCTION: Clinical screening for diabetic neuropathy diagnoses only the tip 
of the iceberg and may miss sub-clinical neuropathies whose progression can be 
prevented/reversed if detected early. Hence, this study was conducted to compare 
nerve conduction (NCS) parameters of adolescents with type 1 Diabetes (T1D) with 
healthy controls and to assess prevalence and risk factors for sub-clinical 
peripheral neuropathy in Indian adolescents with T1D.
METHODS: Case-control study. Cases (n = 120): 10-19 years, T1D duration >2 
years. Exclusion: Comorbidities/illnesses/medication affecting nerve function. 
Controls (n = 40): Healthy, age, sex-matched.
RESULTS: Mean age: 15.1 ± 3 years; diabetes duration: 7 ± 3.5 years, HbA1c: 9.6 
± 2.1%. None had symptoms/signs of peripheral neuropathy. NCS comparison 
demonstrated significantly prolonged latency, reduced action potential duration, 
and nerve conduction velocity (P < 0.01) in motor nerves (median, ulnar, 
peroneal, tibial) in patients with T1D. Sensory action potential duration in 
median and ulnar nerves, and sural conduction velocity were significantly lower 
in T1D (P < 0.05). 26.7% had at least one abnormal NCS parameter. Sub-clinical 
neuropathy prevalence- demyelinating motor: upper limbs (UL)-5.8%, lower limbs 
(LL)-11.7%; demyelinating sensory: UL-5.0%, LL-5.0%; axonal motor: UL-4.2%, 
LL-2.5%; axonal sensory: UL-2.5%, LL-5.0%. Six (5.0%) had stage-1a distal 
symmetrical polyneuropathy. HbA1c (OR = 1.5), age (OR = 1.4), female gender (OR 
= 0.2), iron intake (OR = 0.8), and hypertension (OR = 19.7) were significantly 
associated with sub-clinical neuropathy.
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of sub-clinical peripheral neuropathy in Indian 
adolescents with T1D was considerable, with the highest prevalence observed in 
the lower limbs. Despite no symptoms, NCS parameters were adversely affected in 
T1D, highlighting the need for early NCS-based screening. Poor glycaemic 
control, reduced iron intake, and hypertension were modifiable risk factors 
associated with sub-clinical neuropathy, apart from non-modifiable factors like 
male gender, age.

INTRODUCTION: Septic pulmonary embolism (SPE) is a rare, life-threatening 
condition caused by infected thrombi from extrapulmonary sites lodging in 
pulmonary arteries, resulting in infarction and infection. Its nonspecific 
presentation, including fever, cough, and chest pain, often delays diagnosis. 
Predisposing factors include infective endocarditis, intravascular catheters, 
oropharyngeal infections, and urinary tract infections.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 68-year-old female with hypertension and diabetes mellitus 
arrived with fever, active cough, sudden shortness of breath, and pain in her 
left flank. The chest computed tomography (CT) revealed bilateral lung nodules 
with cavitation, wedge-shaped opacities, and feeding vessel indications, all of 
which were suggestive of SPE. Laboratory tests revealed leukocytosis and 
increased C-reactive protein. Klebsiella pneumoniae was found in both urine and 
sputum cultures. The patient was given empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics and 
ICU care, which included mechanical ventilation. The antibiotic medication was 
adjusted based on culture sensitivity, resulting in gradual clinical 
improvement.
CLINICAL DISCUSSION: SPE diagnosis is difficult due to vague symptoms, but can 
be supported by CT findings such as peripheral nodules, cavitation, wedge-shaped 
lesions, and feeding vessel indications. Early identification of the major 
illness source and the use of targeted broad-spectrum antibiotics are crucial. 
Differential diagnoses include tuberculosis, cancer, necrotizing pneumonia, and 
fungal diseases; fast cavitation and peripheral spread favor SPE.
CONCLUSION: SPE should be suspected in patients with extrapulmonary infections 
presenting with pulmonary nodules or cavitation, particularly when CT shows 
feeding vessel signs. Prompt diagnosis, removal of infectious sources, and 
early, appropriate antibiotic therapy are essential to improve patient outcomes.

Echocardiographic and platelet markers of cardiovascular strain in sickle cell 
disease with superimposed preeclampsia: a perspective.

Author information:
(1)Department of Biomedical and Laboratory Science, Africa University, Mutare, 
Zimbabwe.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) and preeclampsia (PE) are both conditions associated 
with significant vascular dysfunction and increased cardiovascular risk, 
particularly during pregnancy. When PE is superimposed on SCD, the compounded 
pathophysiological effects exacerbate endothelial damage, inflammation, and 
hemodynamic stress, posing substantial risks to maternal and fetal health. 
Echocardiography offers a valuable non-invasive approach to assess cardiac 
function and detect subclinical cardiovascular alterations in pregnant women 
with SCD complicated by PE. Key echocardiographic markers, including left 
ventricular diastolic dysfunction, pulmonary hypertension, and right ventricular 
impairment, provide insight into the extent of cardiovascular compromise. 
Concurrently, platelet activation markers such as mean platelet volume and 
surface expression of adhesion molecules reflect a heightened pro-thrombotic 
state that contributes to vascular injury and disease progression. Integrating 
echocardiographic findings with platelet biomarkers may enhance risk 
stratification and guide targeted interventions to mitigate cardiovascular 
complications in this high-risk population. Further research is needed to 
establish standardized protocols and explore therapeutic avenues aimed at 
reducing maternal morbidity and improving pregnancy outcomes in women with SCD 
and superimposed PE.

OBJECTIVE: Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) is a rare but serious 
condition that can cause intracranial hypertension and hemorrhage. Common risk 
factors include thrombophilia and oral contraceptive use, but jugular Eagle 
syndrome-caused by an elongated styloid process compressing the internal jugular 
vein-is an uncommon yet clinically significant etiology.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 44-year-old woman presented with severe right-sided 
headache, neck pain, and visual disturbances after cervical spine manipulation. 
Imaging revealed extensive CVST with venous congestion hemorrhage, and jugular 
Eagle syndrome was confirmed. Symptoms persisted despite anticoagulation, but 
her headache improved after successful endovascular thrombectomy. Styloidectomy 
was considered for long-term management.
CONCLUSION: Jugular Eagle syndrome is a rare cause of CVST. Anticoagulation 
remains first-line, but thrombectomy may be required in refractory cases, and 
surgical styloidectomy should be considered for definitive management.

Children's Hospital, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital, 
Helsinki, Finland.

Hospital, Helsinki, Finland.

Normalization of serum bilirubin after Kasai portoenterostomy (KPE) is a 
prerequisite for long-term native liver (NL) survival. Following a successful 
KPE, fibrotic liver injury progresses variably, although a significant 
proportion of patients show decreasing histological liver fibrosis during 
follow-up. Eventually, the great majority of patients develop cirrhosis and 
clinical manifestations of portal hypertension (PH), while liver malignancies 
and pulmonary complications of PH occur infrequently. Accurate prediction of 
liver fibrosis remains challenging. Development of reliable noninvasive 
biomarkers of liver fibrosis would improve patient management and benefit 
performance of interventional trials. Although successful KPE modifies liver 
gene expression profile, molecular signature of active fibrogenesis and ductular 
reaction (DR) persists. Successful KPE reduces the abundance of activated 
myofibroblasts and macrophages, whereas cholangiocytes tend to increase. 
Progression of long-term fibrotic liver injury is tightly connected with DR, 
which is associated with serum bile acids. While serum bile acids are predictive 
of portal fibrosis and NL survival, there are ongoing randomized clinical trials 
evaluating the efficacy of bile acids lowering therapies on KPE outcomes. A 
better understanding of disease mechanisms underpinning progression of liver 
injury and clinical complications following successful KPE is needed for the 
development of novel adjuvant therapies, improvement of follow-up, and 
optimizing outcomes.

Schistosoma japonicum infection can cause severe hepatic complications 
associated with portal hypertension, which may lead to death by bleeding from 
esophageal varices. Ultrasonography (US) enables the identification of two 
different types of liver fibrosis characteristic for S. japonicum infection: 
interseptal fibrosis (ISF) and portal fibrosis (PF). To date, these two forms of 
liver fibrosis have not been sufficiently investigated with regard to their 
potential to cause portal hypertension. Among the 121 reports published, only 56 
(46.3%) distinguish between ISF and PF. In 31/56 (55.4%) of these publications, 
patients with only ISF, two (3.6%) with only PF, as well as 23 (41.1%) with 
concomitant ISF and PF, are reported. US signs of portal hypertension are 
reported in 10/25 (40.0%) of publications reporting PF, of which 2/2 (100%) of 
publications report PF alone and 8/23 (34.8%) of publications report concurrent 
PF and ISF. Also, 2/31 (6.5%) of publications report that ISF alone is 
associated with portal hypertension. Thus, PF appears to be the main risk factor 
for portal hypertension. Future studies need to assess the exact nature of liver 
fibrosis caused by S. japonicum in a standardized way to clarify the individual 
contributions of PF and ISF to morbidity.

ObjectiveLupus nephritis (LN) is a major mortality risk factor in patients with 
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). We investigated the predictors of end-stage 
renal disease (ESRD) and mortality in patients with LN.MethodsWe enrolled 599 
Korean patients with biopsy-proven proliferative or membranous LN from a 
prospective cohort of 1497 patients with SLE. Baseline demographics, serology, 
histology, disease activity, and organ damage were collected and assessed. 
Regression models were used to evaluate predictors of renal survival and 
mortality.ResultsWe followed a total of 599 patients with proliferative LN 
(class III or IV/±V, N = 509) or membranous LN (class V, N = 90). Among these 
patients, 42 patients (7.0%) progressed to ESRD and 31 (5.2%) died. In a 
multivariate logistic regression analysis, antiphospholipid antibody positivity 
(OR 3.18, p = .023), higher activity and chronicity indices at biopsy (OR 1.14, 
p = .034; OR 1.33, p = .042), and sustained high disease activity (extra-renal 
adjusted mean Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index-2000 
[SLEDAI-2K] ≥ 3, OR 4.33, p = .019) significantly influenced progression to ESRD 
after adjusting for age at LN diagnosis, gender, disease duration, and 
hypertension. While the 6-month renal response after induction treatment showed 
no association with ESRD risk, the 12-month treatment response demonstrated a 
significant association (p < .001). Renal survival was poorer in patients with 
an activity index ≥6 and in those with a chronicity index ≥4 (p = .013 and p = 
.002, respectively). Patients who developed ESRD had significantly worse overall 
survival than those who did not (p = .028). Higher adjusted mean SLEDAI-2K 
(hazard ratio [HR] 1.43, p < .0001) and higher extra-renal adjusted mean 
SLEDAI-2K (HR 1.83, p < .0001) were significantly associated with increased 
overall mortality.ConclusionsOur study indicates that antiphospholipid 
antibodies, higher histologic activity and chronicity indices, and sustained 
high disease activity beyond renal items were independently associated with 
progression to ESRD. Mortality was increased among patients with ESRD and those 
with persistent high disease activity. These findings emphasize the need for 
stringent disease activity control and support clinicopathologic stratification 
to identify patients at high risk of adverse long-term renal outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Higher doses of anthracyclines and heart-relevant radiotherapy 
increase cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. This study assessed CVD and CVD risk 
factors among adult childhood cancer survivors (CCSs) across cardiotoxic 
treatment risk groups and examined associations between lifestyle behaviors and 
treatment risks.
METHODS: We invited CCSs aged ≥18 years at study, diagnosed at ages 0-20, who 
survived ≥5 years for an assessment of anthropometry, CVD, CVD risk factors, 
lifestyle, and cancer history. We classified participants into three cardiotoxic 
treatment risk groups (no/low risk, moderate risk, high risk) based on 
anthracyclines and heart-relevant radiotherapy. Multinomial logistic regression 
assessed lifestyle differences across groups.
RESULTS: With a median age at study of 33 years (IQR: 26-39; 53% male), 356 CCSs 
participated in this study divided into the no/low risk (25%), moderate risk 
(40%), or high risk (35%) cardiotoxic treatment groups. Overall, CVD prevalence 
was 6% and similar across the three risk groups. Heart valve problems were rare, 
though more common in the high-risk group (no/low risk, 0%; moderate risk, 1%; 
vs. high risk, 4%; p = 0.037). CVD risk factors were present in 44% of 
CCSs-including dyslipidemia, obesity, hypertension, and diabetes-without 
variation across risk groups. Overall adherence to health behavior 
recommendations was low, with no differences in diet adherence, physical 
activity (PA), sedentary behavior, smoking, or alcohol consumption across 
cardiotoxic risk groups.
CONCLUSION: We found no differences in CVD, CVD risk factors, or lifestyle 
behaviors across cardiotoxic treatment risk groups. Health promotion that 
engages diet, PA, smoking cessation, and alcohol reduction should be prioritized 
for all CCSs regardless of cardiotoxic treatment risk levels.

BACKGROUND: Phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitors (PDE5i) are the first-line 
therapy for erectile dysfunction (ED), offering high efficacy and favorable 
safety profiles. However, data on how long PDE5i remain effective before the 
need for penile prosthesis (PP) surgery are limited. This study evaluates the 
duration from PDE5i initiation to PP surgery and identifies predictors of this 
interval.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of patients with ED who initiated 
PDE5i therapy and subsequently underwent PP surgery between January 2019 and 
August 2022. Clinical characteristics, laboratory results, and duration of PDE5i 
use were extracted from hospital records.
RESULTS: A total of 98 patients were included, with a mean age of 56.1 ± 11.5 
years and a mean body mass index (BMI) of 29.8 ± 4.4 kg/m². Comorbidities were 
present in 88.8 % of patients, including diabetes mellitus (75.5 %), 
hypertension (54.1 %), and smoking (31.6 %). The mean time from PDE5i initiation 
to PP surgery was 34.9 ± 24.8 months (≈ 2.9 years). Lower testosterone levels 
were associated with earlier surgery, while comorbidities were not.
CONCLUSIONS: The average duration of PDE5i use prior to PP surgery was 
approximately three years. Lower testosterone levels may predict earlier 
surgical intervention, whereas comorbidities did not show a significant 
association. These findings may assist clinicians in counseling patients and 
planning treatment strategies.

Despite spectacular progress in the treatment of patients diagnosed with cancer, 
cardiovascular diseases are the second leading cause of death in cancer 
patients, after cancer itself. According to the CONNECT-POL registry, 
cardiovascular risk factors are very often detected in cancer patients even 
before starting oncological treatment. The rapidly expanding range of new 
life-saving cancer therapies unfortunately is characterized by a wide range of 
both early and late cardiovascular complications. These include not only the 
classic complications long described as heart failure, but also hypertension, 
dyslipidemia, diabetes, and accelerated atherosclerosis. Preventive strategies 
aimed at their prevention and optimal treatment are crucial for improving both 
oncological and cardiological prognosis. Unfortunately, as is widely known, the 
presence of cancer negatively impacts the quality and intensity of preventive 
measures. In our expert opinion, after a cancer diagnosis, in addition to 
promptly initiating oncological therapy, prevention or addressing existing 
cardiovascular risk factors is also of great importance for the patient's 
further treatment and prognosis. This should generally be done in accordance 
with the principles adopted for the general population, but with certain 
differences for cancer patients, especially if this is a group of patients with 
advanced cancer. It is crucial that these activities are not conducted solely by 
cardiologists, but also with the support of primary care physicians and other 
specialties, including oncologists, with the full cooperation and acceptance of 
the patient. According to the authors of this document, there is a need to 
emphasize the role of primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in cancer 
patients, which has been neglected until now, and our expert opinion summarizes 
these recommendations.

Low dose computed tomography (LDCT) plays a critical role in screening 
individuals for lung cancer. To better understand why its utilization remains 
poor, we analyzed the geospatial distribution of lung cancer screening programs 
in Florida to determine whether the distribution of these programs aligns with 
populations at greatest risk. Accredited programs offering LDCT were identified 
from public databases maintained by the American College of Radiology. 
Age-adjusted incidence and mortality for lung cancer were retrieved from the 
Florida Cancer Data System and Florida Department of Health. County-level 
demographic features were retrieved from the 2022 U.S. Census and Florida 
Department of Health. Univariate Pearson correlations and Kruskal-Wallis 
analyses revealed that screening programs in Florida are more likely to be 
located in counties with greater population density and a greater proportion of 
college-educated residents, physicians per capita and residents with private 
insurance. In contrast, the number of facilities correlated inversely with the 
proportion of current smokers, white residents, and lung cancer incidence and 
mortality. In multivariate analyses, only smoking remained significantly 
associated with disease-specific incidence or mortality. No association between 
outcomes with the number of facilities in each county was identified. In 
conclusion, these findings indicate that the geographic distribution of 
certified screening programs in Florida does not align with lung cancer burden. 
Moving forward, strategies to address this mismatch may be helpful for improving 
the early detection of lung cancer.

BACKGROUND: Paediatric and young adult differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) 
often presents at an advanced stage but carries an excellent prognosis. While 
age-related genomic differences from adult DTC are recognized, it remains 
unclear whether outcomes are driven by age or tumour biology.
METHODS: We analysed a multi-institutional cohort of 363 patients aged 0-25 
years who underwent molecular testing and surgical management. Age was 
categorized using cutoffs at ≤8, 9-14, 15-18, and 19-25 years). The primary 
endpoint was disease status at last follow-up, categorized according to American 
Thyroid Association (ATA) response criteria. Multivariable ordered logistic 
regression was used to test the independent prognostic effect of somatic driver 
mutations while adjusting for age, sex, and follow-up duration.
RESULTS: Distinct age-related patterns of oncogenic drivers were observed: RET 
and NTRK1/3 fusions were predominant in younger patients, BRAF V600E was most 
frequent in adolescents, and RAS mutations were enriched in young adults. After 
adjustment, driver mutations independently predicted long-term outcomes. NTRK1/3 
fusions (aOR 5.29, 95% CI 1.77-15.79), BRAF V600E (aOR 3.45, 95% CI 1.37-8.70), 
and RET fusions (aOR 3.34, 95% CI 1.13-9.90) were associated with significantly 
higher odds of a non-excellent outcome. Conversely, RAS mutations showed a 
favourable trend, and all DICER1-mutant cases achieved excellent outcomes. While 
prognosis steadily improved with age, mutation status remained the dominant 
factor determining outcomes.
CONCLUSION: Somatic drivers offer prognostic insights independent of age in 
paediatric and young adult DTC, establishing a molecular framework for precision 
risk stratification that complements traditional clinical staging and age-based 
assessments.

Monoethyl phthalate, a major metabolite of phthalate esters, is commonly found 
in the environment and has been linked to an increased risk of thyroid cancer. 
This study uses network toxicology to predict molecular initiators involved in 
monoethyl phthalate-induced thyroid cancer and to explore causal relationships 
and biological mechanisms. We identified 72 common candidate genes of monoethyl 
phthalate and thyroid cancer from PubChem, CTD, STITCH, GeneCards, and OMIM 
databases and selected 48 genes for Mendelian Randomization (MR) analysis. Using 
the IEU database and employing expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) as 
instrumental variables (IVs), we executed MR analysis to identify 10 monoethyl 
phthalate-related targets with potential causal relationship to thyroid cancer. 
Gene Ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) 
enrichment analyses highlighted that the biological processes primarily involve 
intracellular receptor signaling, response to estradiol, nuclear receptor 
activity, ligand-activated transcription factor activity, and cancer-related 
signaling pathways, such as the cell cycle and tryptophan metabolism. A 
protein-protein interaction (PPI) network identified interactions between 7 of 
these genes, revealing 5 core genes (ESR1, SKP2, CASP8, ARNT, and CDKN1B) as key 
candidate mediators in monoethyl phthalate-induced thyroid cancer. Molecular 
docking simulations suggested potential direct interactions between monoethyl 
phthalate and their protein products. Our findings propose 10 genes as potential 
mediators of monoethyl phthalate-induced thyroid cancer, with ESR1, SKP2, CASP8, 
ARNT, and CDKN1B highlighted as core factors potentially involved in thyroid 
cancer pathogenesis.

BACKGROUND: The North Central London (NCL) Cancer Alliance carried out a quality 
improvement (QI) project to fill a distinct knowledge gap regarding the quality 
of clinical coded data in a primary care electronic health care record system 
across the whole cancer pathway.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to establish the quality of cancer-related clinical 
coding in NCL primary care, encompassing both quantitative measures (eg, coding 
completeness and diversity) and qualitative dimensions such as clinical 
relevance and workflow alignment.
METHODS: This was a mixed methods QI project in which we combined an 
observational dataset review and qualitative data from stakeholder interviews, 
workshops, and discussions. In the dataset review, we evaluated completeness, 
diversity, validation, and granularity in cancer clinical coding along the 
patient cancer pathway, which was split into three domains: (1) patient 
characteristics and risk factors, (2) cancer screening attendance, and (3) 
living with cancer. It was conducted in NCL primary care electronic health 
record systems, covering a population of over 1.4 million adults across 5 
boroughs.
RESULTS: Cancer-related clinical coding in NCL primary care revealed significant 
gaps despite high completeness for ethnicity (912,679/1,055,083, 86.5%) and 
language (898,023/1,307,601, 68.7%). Employment status (29,848/1,229,644, 2.4%) 
and family history of cancer (183,424/1,236,580, 14.8%) were underrecorded, with 
wide variation in coding practices. Screening data showed good alignment with 
national datasets for cervical and bowel screening but fragmented and 
inconsistent breast screening data due to a lack of standardized codes. Cancer 
diagnosis coding was incomplete (4604/5260, 87.5% recorded), and treatment and 
staging data were almost entirely absent, limiting proactive management of 
long-term consequences. Stakeholder input highlighted inconsistent template use, 
limited data updates, and insufficient incentives as key barriers to better 
coding.
CONCLUSIONS: The QI project has provided a detailed insight into the many 
dimensions of cancer coding and sheds light on many factors that underpin 
variation and coding preference. We offer a number of recommendations. The 
prioritized ones include the need for a cancer clinical coding data framework 
for primary care supported by appropriate funding and incentivization; 
improvements in the breast screening pathway and its interface with primary 
care; improvements in the quality of secondary care information that is sent to 
primary care; and dissemination of the importance of coding of cancer activity 
in primary care.

INTRODUCTION: This study examined how message sidedness (one-sided vs. 
two-sided) and source (expert vs. peer) influence young adults' perceptions of 
e-cigarette heath messages, with attention to differences between those who 
currently vape, those who ever vaped and never vaped.
METHODS: We conducted a 2 (sidedness) x 2 (source) online experiment with a 
sample of young adults (N=802, Mage=21.49). Participants were randomly assigned 
to view 18 messages about the health effects of vaping. After each message, they 
rated message and source perceptions. Following exposure to all messages, they 
completed measures assessing e-cigarette attitudes, risk beliefs, behavioral 
intentions, and demographics. Generalized linear models (GLMs) were used to 
examine the effects of message conditions and vaping status on outcomes, 
adjusting for demographics.
RESULTS: Participants reported higher trust in experts than peers (p<0.001) and 
more positive message perceptions from expert-delivered messages (p=0.048). 
One-sided messages elicited greater perceived threat to freedom (p<0.001) and 
more positive e-cigarette attitudes than two-sided messages (p=0.037) among 
those who currently vape. Two-sided messages elicited greater anger than 
one-sided messages among those who ever vaped (p=0.041). Participants who never 
vaped, ever vaped, and currently vape reported the highest trust in the FDA 
(ps<0.001) and the lowest trust in influencers (ps<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Tailoring message design to audience's vaping status can strengthen 
e-cigarette health messages. Expert sources may be more effective in prevention 
campaigns, while two-sided messages may enhance cessation efforts. Results show 
that message source and sidedness interact with vaping status to meaningfully 
shape message perceptions.

BACKGROUND: The number of cancer survivors aged older than 65 years is rising 
rapidly. Current evidence-based exercise guidelines lack specific guidance for 
older cancer survivors as a result of insufficient evidence. An expert panel was 
convened to develop consensus-based recommendations for exercise in older cancer 
survivors.
METHODS: The development of recommendations was guided by the Grading of 
Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation Evidence-to-Decision 
framework for good practice statements. The panel drew from the available 
literature, a Delphi survey of exercise and health professionals, other exercise 
guidelines, clinical and research expertise, and interest-holder input provided 
by a community advisory board of older cancer survivors and caregivers (n = 11). 
Recommendations had to be deemed accessible (i.e., no added barriers) to older 
cancer survivors and feasible to implement. The panel voted on the strength of 
the recommendation for or against each statement, with consensus set at 85% 
agreement.
RESULTS: Consensus was reached on 11 recommendations covering the following 
areas: medical evaluation/clearance for exercise, pre-exercise assessment, 
exercise prescription, exercise tolerance and safety, exercise delivery, and 
behavioral support. The recommendations aimed to promote engagement in and 
uptake of appropriately prescribed exercise programming by older cancer 
survivors, while keeping barriers and risks as low as possible.
CONCLUSIONS: Older cancer survivors can benefit from appropriately prescribed 
exercise, which should be an essential component of their cancer care. Exercise 
and health professionals need to consider the unique needs of older cancer 
survivors to ensure that exercise is safe and effective for this population, 
while also reducing barriers to reach as many people as possible.

Oligosaccharyltransferase (OST), which is a multi-membrane protein complex that 
catalyzes asparagine-linked glycosylation (N-glycosylation) in the endoplasmic 
reticulum (ER), is a potential target to eradicate refractory cancer. Mammals 
express two distinct OST isoforms (OST-A and OST-B) that exhibit different 
acceptor site specificity to maximize N-glycosylation efficiency; however, the 
role of individual OST isoforms in tumor progression is not fully understood. 
Here, using mouse melanoma model, we showed that gene-edited knockout of either 
one of the OST isoforms did not compromise subcutaneous tumor growth, while 
their co-expression was required for efficient experimental lung metastasis. We 
further showed that the cytosolic N-terminal region of Stt3a, which is the 
catalytic subunit of OST-A, was critical for the N-glycosylation reaction and 
lung metastasis. This study opens a novel avenue for selective manipulation of 
OST-A activity, which might offer potential therapeutic strategies for 
metastatic cancers.

Transplanting allogeneic or even interspecies mitochondria to modulate cancer 
malignancy was investigated herein. Melanoma is a highly metastatic cancer that 
strongly relies on mitochondrial function. The mitochondrial membrane potential 
(MMP) and ATP of human (A375) and mouse (B16F10) melanoma cells, and four donor 
cells, human (HaCaT) and mouse (MPEK-BL6) keratinocytes, human (HUVEC) and mouse 
(MUVEC) endothelial cells were compared. The mitochondrial transplantations 
between mouse and human were identified. HUVEC mitochondria could uniquely 
retard the migration of B16F10. HUVEC mitochondria could be substantially 
transplanted into B16F10 and were colocalized with endogenous B16F10 
mitochondria, in which, the branched mitochondria were converted into globular 
mitochondria. The reduced DRP1 and LC3 II corresponded to the reduced MMP and 
ATP. The decreased TGF-β, NANOG, SOX2, SMAD2/3, AKT, ERK, N-cadherin and MMP-9 
corresponded to the attenuated invasion, elevated ROS and impaired cell 
viability. In conclusion, the feasibility of interspecies mitochondrial 
transplantation was preliminarily validated.

IMPORTANCE: Globally, 968 350 new cases and 659 853 deaths from gastric cancer 
were reported in 2022. In the US, 30 300 new cases and 10 780 deaths were 
estimated in 2025.
OBSERVATIONS: Gastric cancer is more common in men, and the median age at 
diagnosis is 68 years. Most gastric cancers (>90%) are adenocarcinomas. 
Worldwide, 85% of cases arise from the stomach body or antrum and 15% from the 
cardia. In the US, more than 90% of patients diagnosed with gastric cancer 
present with symptoms such as weight loss and abdominal pain. At presentation, 
approximately 13% have localized disease (limited to the stomach), 15% to 25% 
have locally advanced disease, defined as a tumor that has spread to regional 
lymph nodes, and 35% to 65% have metastatic disease. Helicobacter pylori 
infection is a treatable risk factor associated with 90% of gastric body and 
antrum cancers globally. Additional modifiable risk factors include smoking, 
alcohol, obesity, and salt intake. In countries with high incidence such as 
Japan and Korea, routine endoscopic screening beginning at age 40 years is 
associated with improved survival. Diagnosis is made by endoscopic biopsy. 
Patients with localized gastric cancer are treated with surgical resection and 
have a 5-year relative survival rate of 75% with treatment. Patients with more 
advanced-stage disease should receive gastrectomy, perioperative chemotherapy 
with 5-fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, and docetaxel and immunotherapy (durvalumab). 
Metastatic or unresectable disease may be treated with chemotherapy, 
immunotherapy, and/or targeted therapy depending on biomarkers, including 
programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 
(ERBB2; formerly HER2 or HER2/neu), and claudin-18, isoform 2 (CLDN18.2). For 
PD-L1-expressing gastric cancer, adding immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as 
nivolumab and pembrolizumab, is associated with an additional 3 months of 
survival when compared with chemotherapy alone. For gastric cancers 
overexpressing the ERBB2 or CLDN18.2 proteins, the addition of trastuzumab or 
zolbetuximab, respectively, is associated with an additional 3 to 4 months' 
survival. Early supportive care focusing on symptom management and on 
nutritional and psychosocial support is associated with 3 months of survival 
benefit. Less than 10% of patients with metastatic gastric cancer survive more 
than 5 years.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Approximately 30 300 new cases of gastric cancer are 
diagnosed annually in the US. Localized gastric cancer is treated with 
gastrectomy, and locally advanced disease is treated with surgery and 
chemoimmunotherapy. For patients with unresectable or metastatic gastric cancer, 
chemotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors and targeted therapies such as 
trastuzumab or zolbetuximab improves survival by several months.

ESR1 mutations are the leading cause of endocrine therapy resistance and 
progression in ER-positive metastatic breast cancer. ESR1 mutations are detected 
in ~50% of metastatic breast cancer patients, and identification of effective 
targeted therapeutics are critically needed. Here, we identified enrichment of 
dysregulated replication stress and DNA damage responses in multiple ESR1 mutant 
models. Targeting the replication stress response utilizing checkpoint 
inhibition in combination with PARP inhibition synergistically suppressed 
growth, induced cell cycle arrest, and attenuated DNA replication. PARP 
inhibition blocked metastatic dissemination in vivo and reduced both PARP1 and 
ER-regulated protein expression. PARP trapping by olaparib treatment with or 
without endocrine therapy resulted in a significant increase of co-localized 
DNA-bound PARP1 and ER protein in ESR1 mutant cells, indicating ER-PARP1 
co-regulation in ESR1 mutant breast cancer. Long-term treatment with endocrine 
therapy plus the CDK4/6 inhibitor abemaciclib led to the emergence of a Y537S 
ESR1 mutation in a cell line, which exhibited dysregulation of replication 
stress response, enhanced DNA damage response, and synergistic responses to 
inhibitors of these pathways. PARP inhibition also synergized with clinically 
relevant endocrine therapy in ESR1 mutant models, reducing tumor growth both ex 
vivo and in vivo. Together, these results identify replication stress and DNA 
damage responses as key dysregulated pathways in ESR1 mutant breast cancer with 
significant clinical potential for PARP inhibition in this metastatic breast 
cancer subset.

Risk-Reducing Bilateral Mastectomy and Mortality in Carriers of BRCA1 and BRCA2 
Variants: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.

O'Reilly C(1), McGarry JL(1), Zaborowski AM(1), Davey MG(1), Evoy D(1), Rothwell 
J(1), McCartan D(1), Rutherford CL(1), Boland MR(1), Prichard RS(1).

IMPORTANCE: Risk-reducing bilateral mastectomy reduces the incidence of breast 
cancer in female carriers of the BRCA pathogenic variants, but its association 
with mortality remains uncertain.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between risk-reducing bilateral 
mastectomy and overall and breast cancer-specific mortality in female carriers 
of BRCA pathogenic variants.
DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, Embase, and CENTRAL were searched in May 
2025, with English-language restriction and no date limit. Reference lists of 
included studies and relevant reviews were also examined.
STUDY SELECTION: Eligible studies compared female carriers of BRCA1 and BRCA2 
pathogenic variants who underwent risk-reducing bilateral mastectomy with those 
who did not and reported overall mortality or breast cancer-specific mortality. 
Studies including patients with a history of breast cancer were excluded.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: This meta-analysis followed the Meta-Analysis of 
Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines. Two authors 
independently performed study selection, data extraction, and risk of bias 
assessment (using Risk of Bias in Nonrandomized Studies-of Interventions, 
version 2). Odds ratios (ORs) and hazard ratios (HRs) were pooled using fixed- 
and random-effects models according to methodological assessment.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Overall and breast cancer-specific mortality.
RESULTS: Six observational studies met the inclusion criteria, comprising 6135 
carriers of the BRCA1 or BRCA2 variant. Weighted median age at inclusion was 
38.0 years, with reported age ranges spanning 15.3 to 85.3 years. Risk-reducing 
bilateral mastectomy was associated with lower overall mortality in both 
unadjusted (OR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.27-0.55; P < .001) and adjusted (HR, 0.37; 95% 
CI, 0.23-0.60; P < .001) analyses. Breast cancer-specific mortality was also 
reduced (OR, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.08-0.47; P < .001; HR, 0.14; 95% CI, 0.04-0.49; 
P = .002).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Risk-reducing bilateral mastectomy was associated 
with lower overall and breast cancer-specific mortality in carriers of the BRCA 
variants. These findings support the role of risk-reducing bilateral mastectomy 
as a potentially life-extending intervention and may inform the shared 
decision-making discussions in these women.

IMPORTANCE: Hospital global budgets gained attention as a strategy to constrain 
costs and improve outcomes. The Maryland all-payer model (APM), initiated in 
2014 as a global budget revenue model, is an example of full-risk payment 
reform; yet frontline surgeon perspectives on the implementation and impact of 
this APM have not been evaluated.
OBJECTIVE: To examine surgeon experiences working under Maryland's APM.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This qualitative study used a convergent 
mixed-methods design to assess survey responses of surgeon experiences and 
semistructured interviews between June 15 and November 25, 2024. Maryland 
surgeons were recruited via purposive and snowball sampling for surveys from 
academic and community surgical practices. A nested sample of respondents was 
selected for qualitative interviews using maximum variation sampling.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was surgeon-reported experiences 
with Maryland's APM. Surveys and interview guides were designed using the 
Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) to assess awareness, 
communication, institutional engagement, changes in practice, and perceived 
effects on care delivery associated with the APM. Survey responses were 
summarized, and interview data were thematically analyzed and integrated using 
CFIR-guided joint displays.
RESULTS: Among 121 identified surgeons, 103 responded to the survey (67 [65.0%] 
male; practicing a mean [SD] of 16.4 [12.7] years), and 88 (85.4%) reported 
awareness of the APM. Of these 88 surgeons, a minority (35 [38.8%]) recalled 
information being distributed by their institution, and 41 (46.6%) reported 
receiving information from peers. Whereas 52 surgeons (59.1%) agreed that 
complex care had become more centralized, fewer believed that the model improved 
referral management (15 [17.0%] strongly agreed or agreed) or reduced 
preventable hospital use (16 [18.2%] strongly agreed or agreed). Most surgeons 
stated that the model changed the way they practiced at least slightly (56 
[63.6%]). In qualitative interviews (n = 25), surgeons described surface-level 
understanding of the model and limited institutional communication, relying on 
peer discussions to interpret its implications. Many surgeons expressed 
confusion about performance expectations and frustration with the lack of 
feedback on quality metrics. They also noted that financial incentives shifted 
complex care to tertiary centers, contributing to resource strain.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this mixed-methods study of surgeons' experiences, 
surgeons reported high awareness of Maryland's APM, but integrated findings 
revealed limited operational understanding, inconsistent institutional 
communication, and indirect effects on practice. Implementing alternative 
payment models may require more deliberate engagement of clinician stakeholders, 
clearer communication strategies, and alignment of clinical incentives.

IMPORTANCE: Elevated lipoprotein(a) predicts high risk of cardiovascular disease 
among a modest proportion of healthy individuals, an issue that complicates 
screening guidelines.
OBJECTIVE: To examine spline models, clinical thresholds, and percentiles of 
baseline lipoprotein(a) levels as 30-year determinants of cardiovascular risk.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study was conducted among female 
health professionals participating in the Women's Health Study, who were 
followed up prospectively from 1993 to 2023. Women without cardiovascular 
disease, cancer, and other major chronic illnesses had blood samples taken at 
baseline. All individuals with lipoprotein(a) measurements and/or of European 
ancestry with genotype information for the LPA rs3798220 variation were 
included. Data analyses were performed from January through April 2025.
EXPOSURES: Continuously valued baseline lipoprotein(a), lipoprotein(a) clinical 
thresholds and percentiles, and LPA rs3798220 genotypes known to predict 
lipoprotein(a) levels among individuals of European ancestry.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcomes were incident major 
cardiovascular events, coronary heart disease, ischemic stroke, and 
cardiovascular death. Age- and multivariable-adjusted cause-specific Cox models 
were used to calculated hazard ratios for the cardiovascular outcomes. The 
hypothesis was formulated after collection of the data.
RESULTS: A total of 27 748 women with baseline lipoprotein(a) measurements and 
23 279 women of European ancestry with rs3798220 genotype information were 
included (median [IQR] age, 53 [49-60] years), among whom 3707 and 3165 major 
cardiovascular events, respectively, accrued during a median (IQR) follow-up 
period of 27.8 (22.8-29.4) years. Among women with lipoprotein(a) measurements, 
lipoprotein(a) levels above 30 mg/dL or the 75th percentile (31 mg/dL) were 
associated with increased 30-year risk of major cardiovascular events and 
coronary heart disease. Levels above 120 mg/dL or the 99th percentile (131 
mg/dL) were associated with increased risk of ischemic stroke and cardiovascular 
death. Multivariable adjusted hazard ratios for levels above 120 mg/dL vs below 
10 mg/dL or above the 99th percentile vs below the 50th percentile (11 mg/dL) 
were 1.54 (95% CI, 1.24-1.92) and 1.74 (95% CI, 1.35-2.25) for major 
cardiovascular events, 1.80 (95% CI, 1.36-2.37) and 2.06 (95% CI, 1.49-2.84) for 
coronary heart disease, 1.41 (95% CI, 0.93-2.15) and 1.85 (95% CI, 1.17-2.93) 
for ischemic stroke, and 1.63 (95% CI, 1.16-2.28) and 1.86 (95% CI, 1.26-2.72) 
for cardiovascular death, respectively. Among women with genotype information, 
rs3798220 minor allele carriers had a higher risk of major cardiovascular 
events.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Per the results of this cohort study, very high 
lipoprotein(a) levels correlated with increased 30-year risk of cardiovascular 
disease among healthy women. Screening for elevated lipoprotein(a) in the 
general population may be warranted.

IMPORTANCE: Accurate classification of dermatologic conditions using 
International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes is essential for research 
that uses large administrative datasets. Misclassification can be associated 
with biased epidemiologic estimates and misleading conclusions in 
population-based studies.
OBJECTIVE: To systematically identify and evaluate validated classification 
approaches for dermatologic conditions using ICD codes in US-based 
administrative, claims, or electronic health record data.
EVIDENCE REVIEW: A systematic review was conducted that was registered with 
PROSPERO (CRD420250654233) and reported according to Preferred Reporting Items 
for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. A comprehensive search of 
Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and CINAHL was conducted for studies 
published from January 1, 2000, to October 21, 2025. The data were analyzed in 
October 2025. Eligible studies evaluated International Classification of 
Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) or International Statistical Classification of 
Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes used to 
identify dermatologic conditions in US-based datasets and reported at least 1 
classification metric (eg, positive predictive value). To minimize selection and 
extraction bias, all screening and data extraction were performed independently 
by 2 reviewers, with discrepancies resolved by consensus.
FINDINGS: A total of 59 studies met inclusion criteria. Most reported positive 
predictive value, with few reporting sensitivity or specificity. Classification 
accuracy varied widely by condition and coding strategy. Studies included 
inflammatory and autoimmune conditions (eg, acne vulgaris, perioral dermatitis, 
psoriasis, palmoplantar pustulosis, hidradenitis suppurativa, atopic dermatitis, 
prurigo nodularis, dermatomyositis, cutaneous lupus erythematosus, pyoderma 
gangrenosum, cutaneous sarcoidosis, pemphigus, pemphigoid, granuloma annulare, 
alopecia areata, and vitiligo), actinic keratosis and skin cancer, pigmentary 
and hair disorders (eg, androgenic alopecia, cicatricial alopecia, lichen 
planopilaris, and melasma), drug reactions (eg, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic 
epidermal necrolysis), and infections (eg, herpes zoster, herpes simplex virus, 
and cellulitis or abscess). Classification algorithms that incorporated 2 or 
more codes, dermatologist attribution, or treatment/procedural data often 
achieved the highest accuracy. Conditions lacking validated algorithms included 
seborrheic dermatitis, rosacea, fungal infections, and specific alopecia 
subtypes.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This systematic review provides a summary of the most 
accurate classification approaches to identify various dermatologic conditions 
in large administrative datasets. These results may inform study designs when 
using these datasets. In addition, some common conditions lack validated 
classification approaches, highlighting important areas for future research. As 
administrative and electronic health record data increasingly support 
dermatology research, use of rigorously validated algorithms will be essential 
for generating trustworthy findings.

Spatiotemporal sensors capable of monitoring analyte activity in subcellular 
compartments of cells are critical to advancing our understanding of complex 
disease progression. Nitric oxide (NO) plays a key role in tumor progression, 
yet its precise function remains unclear due to its bimodal effect, which is 
influenced by its subcellular distribution. Factors such as membrane 
permeability, NO reactivity, and redox states of intracellular compartments may 
determine whether NO promotes or suppresses tumor growth. Current sensors are 
limited in providing spatial and temporal information about NO in live cells. 
Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNT), specifically (6,5) SWNT functionalized 
with (AT)15 DNA, have demonstrated potential for intracellular NO detection, but 
their organelle-specific localization and stability are unknown. In this study, 
we investigated the subcellular distribution, stability, and retention of (AT)15 
SWNT sensors in triple-negative breast cancer cells to assess their suitability 
for long-term intracellular NO sensing. Fluorescence and hyperspectral 
microscopies were used to examine the localization of the SWNT sensors within 
the live cells. Our findings reveal that SWNT sensors have an initial higher 
colocalization with mitochondria followed by a time-dependent translocation to 
lysosomes. They do not alter basic cell functions, and they remain stable over 
time. These factors make (AT)15 SWNT ideal for studies elucidating the bimodal 
effects of NO in cancer progression, particularly by providing insights into 
organelle-specific NO dynamics.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Palliative surgery in oncology aims to relieve 
symptoms, improve quality of life, and respect patient autonomy in advanced 
cancer. This study aimed to develop evidence-based recommendations for safely 
indicating and performing palliative surgeries in Brazil, considering clinical, 
ethical, and multidisciplinary aspects.
METHODS: A modified Delphi consensus was conducted with nine experts from the 
Brazilian Society of Surgical Oncology, including surgical and clinical 
oncologists, palliative care specialists, and a psychologist. Sixteen key 
recommendations were formulated based on literature review and a national survey 
identifying gaps in training, communication, and technical safety. Consensus was 
defined as ≥ 80% agreement, achieved in a single round.
RESULTS: Recommendations emphasize individualized patient selection based on 
functional status, frailty, prognosis, and symptom severity. Multidisciplinary 
evaluation, shared decision-making, clear communication, and consideration of 
minimally invasive techniques were prioritized. Palliative procedures focus on 
symptom control rather than survival extension, with evidence supporting 
improved quality of life, reduced hospital admissions, and enhanced oral intake.
CONCLUSIONS: Palliative surgery should be guided by strict clinical criteria, 
multidisciplinary planning, and patient-centered communication. Active patient 
participation, ethical deliberation, and evidence-based practices ensure safe, 
effective, and humanized care, avoiding futile or disproportionate 
interventions.

PURPOSE: Depression is common among patients with cancer and is associated with 
worse quality of life (QoL). However, less is known about how a history of 
depression affects QoL in long-term cancer survivors. This study examined 
whether cancer survivors with a history of depression report poorer QoL compared 
to those without.
METHODS: Data from the 2022 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), 
a nationally representative, phone-based survey, were analyzed. Adults 
aged ≥ 18 years with a self-reported history of cancer were stratified by 
history of depression. Demographics and QoL indicators-including emotional 
support, social isolation, cognitive concerns, and functional independence-were 
compared using chi-square tests. Multivariable logistic regression analyses 
evaluated whether depression was independently associated with QoL outcomes 
after adjustment for demographic and socioeconomic factors.
RESULTS: Of 72,765 cancer survivors identified, 72,443 (99.6%) responded to the 
depression history item and were included. Compared with survivors without 
depression, those with depression were younger, less likely to be married, and 
more likely to report lower income, obesity, and smoking (all p < 0.001). 
Survivors with depression reported worse mental (35% vs. 6%) and physical health 
(34% vs. 15%), lower life satisfaction (15% vs. 3%), reduced emotional support 
(66% vs. 84%), and greater functional limitations (all p < 0.001). After 
adjustment for socioeconomic factors, depression remained independently 
associated with poorer QoL across multiple domains. Depression prevalence was 
highest among survivors of brain (38%) and gynecologic cancers (36%).
CONCLUSIONS: Depression among cancer survivors is independently associated with 
poorer quality of life across emotional, social, and functional domains, 
underscoring the importance of depression screening and intervention in 
survivorship care.
IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Integrating depression screening and 
psychosocial interventions into survivorship care is critical to improving 
long-term well-being and daily functioning.

The progression of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), a frequent cancer of the 
mouth, has been associated with EIF2AK2 dysregulation, but its precise 
mechanisms are yet to be clarified. In this study, we investigated the 
expression of EIF2AK2 in OSCC tissues and cell lines using publicly available 
databases and Western blotting. EIF2AK2 was silenced using small interfering RNA 
(siRNA), and its functional impact on OSCC malignant characteristics was 
determined using several in vitro experiments. Additionally, we determined 
EIF2AK2's impact on autophagy levels and the activity of mechanistic pathways. 
Our results demonstrate that EIF2AK2 is markedly overexpressed in OSCC tissues 
and cell lines, and its knockdown significantly affects OSCC malignant 
characteristics, such as proliferation, migration, and invasion. Furthermore, 
EIF2AK2 knockdown increased E-cadherin levels while reducing those of N-cadherin 
and Vimentin, supporting EMT suppression. It also led to reduced autophagy based 
on decreased LC3-II and Beclin-1 and increased p62 expressions. Moreover, 
inhibition of EIF2AK2 led to the downregulation of the JAK2/STAT3 axis. 
Collectively, these findings support EIF2AK2 as an oncogene in OSCC progression 
by activating autophagy through the JAK2/STAT3 pathway.

Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a prevalent and 
debilitating complication of cancer treatment, characterized by sensory 
dysfunction, including allodynia and hyperalgesia. Despite its clinical 
significance, there are no FDA-approved preventive options for CIPN, and current 
symptom management remains limited in effectiveness. Recent insights into CIPN's 
underlying mechanisms have highlighted the roles of neuroimmune interactions and 
ion channel dysfunction, particularly involving nicotinic acetylcholine 
receptors (nAChRs). Notably, the α7 and α9 nAChR subtypes play a critical role 
in controlling neuronal excitability and inflammatory responses in both 
peripheral and central sensory pathways. Conopeptides, a group of disulfide-rich 
peptides from cone snail venom, have attracted attention as highly selective 
modulators of ion channels involved in pain pathways. This review highlights 
α-conotoxins targeting nAChRs, specifically RgIA4 and GeXIVA[1,2], which have 
dual therapeutic effects by blocking pain signals and reducing 
neuroinflammation. We explore the structural variety and functional specificity 
of conopeptides, their mechanisms in CIPN animal models, and their potential as 
disease-modifying agents. The review also covers recent advances in peptide 
engineering aimed at improving cross-species compatibility, receptor 
selectivity, and serum stability of conopeptides in targeting nAChR. The article 
highlights the potential of nAChR-targeting conopeptides as next-generation 
treatments for CIPN, outlining key challenges and future directions for clinical 
development.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the value of heat shock protein 90α 
(HSP90α) in predicting treatment response and progression-free survival (PFS) 
among patients with lung cancer.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 585 patients with lung cancer treated at 
Jilin Cancer Hospital between January 2014 and December 2023. Patients were 
categorized by pretreatment HSP90α levels into high- and low-level groups and by 
posttreatment changes after four cycles into increasing and decreasing groups. 
We assessed the association between baseline HSP90α levels and clinical 
characteristics, its correlation with treatment efficacy and PFS, and its 
combined predictive ability with classical tumor biomarkers (CEA, NSE, and SCC).
RESULTS: High pretreatment HSP90α levels were associated with older age and 
specific pathological types and served as an independent risk factor for shorter 
PFS. Patients with low baseline HSP90α levels exhibited a better short-term 
treatment response and longer PFS than did those with high baseline HSP90α 
levels. Increasing HSP90α after treatment correlated with an improved response 
and prolonged PFS. HSP90α levels were positively correlated with CEA, NSE, and 
SCC levels. Notably, the combination of HSP90α and CEA expression significantly 
enhanced PFS prediction in patients with lung adenocarcinoma.
CONCLUSIONS: HSP90α is a significant predictive biomarker for treatment efficacy 
and prognosis in lung cancer patients, particularly when it is combined with 
traditional markers such as CEA.

Gasless transaxillary endoscopic thyroidectomy (GTET) offers an extracervical 
approach with cosmetic benefits, yet spatial orientation around critical 
structures can be challenging for learners. We aimed to standardize and 
illustrate a stepwise GTET workflow with clearly annotated intraoperative 
landmarks. This single-center descriptive study presents a unified, stepwise 
technique for GTET. High-resolution intraoperative images were annotated 
in-figure (arrows and labels) to identify constant landmarks and "risk zones," 
including the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN; trunk/entry), inferior parathyroid 
and feeding vessels, Berry ligament, tracheal plane, external branch of the 
superior laryngeal nerve (EBSLN) corridor, upper-pole dissection plane, and 
central compartment boundaries. For each step, concise tips and pitfalls are 
provided to support reproducibility and teaching. An atlas-style, annotated 
workflow is presented that links exposure, landmark identification, and safe 
dissection planes. The figures and legends prioritize consistent orientation 
cues and highlight commonly hazardous areas (e.g., Berry ligament region, RLN 
entry, inferior parathyroid pedicle), aiming to reduce ambiguity for 
less-experienced surgeons. This annotated, stepwise description of GTET may 
facilitate surgical orientation, communication, and training. The framework is 
intended to be adaptable across learning environments; future prospective 
studies should evaluate learning curves and clinical outcomes using standardized 
endpoints.

Neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) are rare cancers. CD31/PECAM1 is an adhesion 
molecule that modulates endothelial cell-to-cell contact. Increased CD31 
expression is a marker for tumor growth, and cancer aggressiveness. The purpose 
of this study was to better understand the prognostic value of CD31 expression 
in primary and metastatic NEN tumors in terms of correlations with overall 
survival and pathological metrics, tumor grade, and tumor primary/metastatic 
location. As NENs are highly vascular tumors, the hypothesis is that CD31 
staining is an important prognostic biomarker and target. This is based on prior 
correlations between CD31 staining and 3-year recurrence-free survival in 
pancreas NENs.
METHODS: NEN tumors, surgically removed within our dedicated multi state 
southern regional neuroendocrine program, are routinely stained for CD31. 
Quantification of CD31 staining was performed by staff pathologists and 
documented in the pathology report within the patient medical record and stored 
in the rare cancer program RedCap database. The database covers surgical 
activity between 2004 and 2024. The database was queried for NET patients with 
quantified CD31 levels (number of positive vessels per high power field (HPF)) 
in primary or metastatic NEN tumors. CD31 levels were cross referenced against 
demographics, tumor grade, primary and metastatic tumor location, and overall 
survival.
RESULTS: Nine hundred and thirteen NET patients were identified. Primary tumor: 
Small Bowel (74%), Pancreas (15%), Lung (2%), Stomach (5%), & Rectum (4%).
DEMOGRAPHICS: Female 59±8.6%, Non-Hispanic 93.4±2%, White/Caucasian 70.4±14.3%, 
& Black/African American 21.6±16%. Grade: G1 45±8%, G2 44±3.6, G3 11±5.8%. There 
were no statistical differences in CD31 staining levels (cells/HPF) between (1) 
NEN tumors from small bowel (33 ± 17), pancreas (39.7 ± 34), lung (44 ± 27), 
stomach (39 ± 27), and rectum (32 ± 19) (p > 0.05), (2) tumor grade (G1. 
31 ± 16; G2. 30 ± 16; and G3. 25 ± 12) (p > 0.05), (3) between matched primary 
and metastatic tumors (lymph node metastasis. 29 ± 16 vs. primary tumor 30 ± 14 
(p = 0.46); liver metastasis 30 ± 18 vs. primary tumor 32 ± 17 (p = 0.17), & (4) 
no correlation between CD31 staining and overall survival (r = 0.01).
CONCLUSION: NEN tumors are highly vascularized and consistently positive for 
CD31. Despite reports that CD31/PACAM1 is important to cell adhesion and tumor 
phenotype, there was no identifiable measurable impact of high CD31 levels on 
NEN. Nor was there a prognostic clinical value for CD31 staining quantification.

PURPOSE: This study aimed to analyze the natural history and radiological 
progression and malignancy of Bosniak IIF renal cysts based on the 2019 version 
of the classification.
METHODS: We conducted a single-center retrospective observational study, 
reviewing radiology reports from CT scans performed between March 2007 and 
December 2021. The final cohort included 85 patients with at least two imaging 
studies. Demographic, clinical, and radiological data, including cyst size, 
septal characteristics, and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) findings, were 
analyzed. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox regression models were applied 
to identify potential predictors of cyst progression.
RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 46 months (IQR 30-71), 5 patients (6%) 
experienced cyst progression: 4 to Bosniak III and 1 to Bosniak IV with 
simultaneous detection of liver metastases. The median time to progression was 
10.3 months (IQR 9-24). Among the four surgically treated cases, 
histopathological analyses confirmed renal cell carcinoma in two, a multicystic 
nephroma in one, and a benign lesion in the remaining case. Contrast-enhanced 
ultrasound (CEUS) was performed in 45% of patients. On univariable analysis, 
larger cyst size (HR 1.02; 95% CI 1.01-1.04) and septal enhancement on CEUS (HR 
12.4; 95% CI 1.28-120.7) were associated with progression.
CONCLUSION: The risk of malignancy in Bosniak IIF cysts remains low, with a 
malignancy rate of 3.5%. Lesion size appears to be associated with progression, 
supporting its potential role in informing follow-up strategies. The first year 
of surveillance seems to be particularly critical, and an early reassessment at 
6 months may facilitate the identification of lesions at higher risk of 
progression.

BACKGROUND: Positive peritoneal cytology (CY1) is classified as stage IV gastric 
cancer and typically treated with systemic chemotherapy. However, upfront 
surgery is sometimes performed when CY1 is identified intraoperatively or 
postoperatively and may improve long-term survival when followed by adjuvant 
chemotherapy. It remains unclear which patients benefit most from this approach. 
This study aimed to identify patient subgroups likely to achieve long-term 
survival with upfront surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed patients diagnosed with P0CY1 who underwent 
upfront surgery between 2008 and 2020. Prognostic factors for overall survival 
(OS) and progression-free survival were evaluated using univariate and 
multivariate analyses.
RESULTS: A total of 147 patients were included; 65% were male, with a median age 
of 72 years. Macroscopic types 3 and 4 were present in 80% of patients, 91% had 
pathological T4 tumors, and 63% had lymph node metastasis. Total gastrectomy was 
performed in 54%, and 81% received adjuvant chemotherapy. Median OS was 
27.0 months. Univariate analysis showed age, macroscopic type, tumor size, and 
adjuvant chemotherapy were significantly associated with OS. Multivariate 
analysis identified adjuvant chemotherapy tumor size  ≥  80 mm, and macroscopic 
types 1 and 2 as independent favorable prognostic factors. Among patients 
receiving adjuvant chemotherapy, those with macroscopic types 1 and 2 had 
significantly better OS (5-year OS rate: 46%) compared to types 3 and 4.
CONCLUSIONS: In P0CY1 gastric cancer, upfront surgery followed by adjuvant 
chemotherapy may result in long-term survival, particularly in patients with 
macroscopic types 1 and 2.

Young adults (18-26 years) are at high risk of human papillomavirus (HPV) 
exposure. Yet, HPV vaccine uptake is suboptimal among young adults. Provider 
recommendation is frequently the most influential factor in HPV vaccine 
acceptance. Evidence-based strategies are needed to facilitate provider 
recommendations for young adults. To inform provider-level strategies for 
recommending the HPV vaccine to young adult patients, the current study aims to 
understand current practices and barriers and facilitators to both recommending 
the HPV vaccine for young adults and for young adults to receive the HPV 
vaccine. Primary care providers (e.g., physicians, nurses; n = 15) in the United 
States completed a semi-structured interview guided by the Consolidated 
Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). Data were analyzed thematically 
using Nvivo. Most participants identified as female (80%), White (67%), and 
non-Hispanic (93%). Participants reported varying their HPV vaccine discussions 
based on visit type (acute vs. wellness) and if the patient is new or 
established in their practice. Participants reported barriers to HPV vaccination 
in young adults across several CFIR domains including outer setting (e.g., 
transient living situation), inner setting (e.g., lack of availability of 
vaccine in clinic), individual (e.g., sex differences), and process (e.g., 
burnout). Facilitators included considering the HPV vaccine as a high priority 
and scheduling future vaccine appointments at the current visit. Evidence-based 
interventions to increase HPV vaccine uptake among young adults are needed. 
Healthcare providers identified multilevel barriers to both recommending and 
delivering the HPV vaccine to their young adult patients.

Publisher: Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination is a cancer prevention 
strategy. The current manuscript provides insights about barriers and 
facilitators to HPV vaccination among young adults which can inform intervention 
strategies, including patient and provider education.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the leading cause of cervical cancer, a major 
public health challenge in Tanzania. National and global efforts continue to 
prioritise HPV vaccination; however, coverage remains suboptimal. In Tanga City, 
no prior data exists on HPV vaccine uptake. This study assesses HPV vaccine 
uptake and factors influencing parental acceptance among girls aged 9-14 years. 
A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 409 parents or 
guardians selected through multistage cluster sampling. Data were collected 
using structured interviewer-administered questionnaires. Descriptive statistics 
determined uptake, while bivariate and multivariate logistic regression were 
used to identify predictors of HPV vaccine uptake, with significance set at 
p < 0.05. HPV vaccine uptake was 57.2%. Parental age < 30 years (AOR = 0.411; 
95% CI: 0.221-0.765), secondary education (AOR = 0.340; 95% CI: 0.124-0.930) and 
living within 5 km of a vaccination point (AOR = 0.478; 95% CI: 0.246-0.929), 
were associated with lower uptake, while being married and school-based 
vaccination increased uptake (AOR = 2.898; 95% CI: 1.723-4.876; AOR = 10.275; 
95% CI: 5.518-19.133). Knowledge, attitudes, and healthcare worker 
recommendation showed no significant association in the multivariate model. HPV 
vaccine uptake in Tanga remains below national and global targets (90%). 
Parental demographics, access-related factors, and school-based delivery play a 
central role in uptake. Strengthening school-based vaccination, enhancing parent 
engagement, particularly among younger and more educated parents, and addressing 
contextual barriers may improve coverage and contribute to cervical cancer 
prevention efforts in Tanzania.

Although immune checkpoint inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in advanced 
gastric cancer, reports of long-term complete remission in early-stage disease 
are lacking. We report a case of a 75-year-old man who presented with concurrent 
malignant melanoma and early gastric cancer (cT1bN0M0). Following surgical 
excision of melanoma with positive sentinel lymph node biopsy (T3bN1M0 Stage 
III), we prioritized treatment of advanced melanoma over early gastric cancer 
and initiated nivolumab adjuvant therapy every 2 weeks. After six cycles, 
treatment was discontinued due to drug-induced pneumonitis with elevated KL-6 
levels. Repeat endoscopy performed 2 months after initial examination revealed 
partial tumor regression, with complete disappearance of the gastric lesion 
confirmed 4 months later. Histopathological examination showed no malignant 
findings. The patient achieved complete response of gastric cancer with only six 
cycles of nivolumab, despite negative PD-L1 expression (combined positive score 
0%). During 6 years of follow-up, endoscopic and CT examinations consistently 
showed no gastric cancer recurrence, maintaining complete response. This case 
demonstrates sustained long-term efficacy of nivolumab against early gastric 
cancer, achieving 6-year disease-free survival with minimal treatment exposure. 
These findings suggest that immune checkpoint inhibitors may represent potential 
treatment options for patients with early gastric cancer contraindicated for 
surgery, even in PD-L1-negative cases.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate subclinical cardiac dysfunction and its association with 
treatment exposure and metabolic risk factors in a cohort of asymptomatic 
childhood cancer survivors (CCS).
METHODS: In this cross-sectional, observational, single-centre study, pediatric 
and young adult CCS were evaluated. Eligible participants were diagnosed before 
18 years of age and had completed cancer therapy at least two years prior to 
enrolment. Data on cancer history, treatment exposures, and comorbidities were 
extracted from electronic medical records. Cardiovascular evaluation included 
history, physical examination, electrocardiogram, and comprehensive 
2D-echocardiography with global longitudinal strain (GLS) analysis. Cumulative 
anthracycline-equivalent doses (CAE) and radiation exposure to the heart were 
documented.
RESULTS: Out of 456 CCS, anthracycline exposure was noted in 88% [mean (SD) CAE 
dose: 178.1 (123.2) mg/m2], and 6.3% had received cardiac radiation. The median 
(Q1, Q3) age at evaluation was 15 (10, 19) years, with a median (Q1, Q3) 
follow-up of 6.5 (4.9, 9.3) years. Left ventricular ejection fraction was 
reduced in 2.8%, while abnormal GLS was detected in 41.4%. On multivariable 
logistic regression, abnormal GLS was independently associated with CAE 
dose > 250 mg/m2 (P = 0.012), obesity (P = 0.004) and hypertriglyceridemia 
(P = 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Abnormal GLS was prevalent in over 40% of asymptomatic CCS. Higher 
anthracycline exposure and presence of obesity and dyslipidemia were linked with 
subclinical cardiac dysfunction. These findings underscore the need for routine 
cardiac surveillance using strain imaging and aggressive management of 
modifiable risk factors to mitigate long-term cardiovascular morbidity in CCS.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness and safety of cyclophosphamide and 
topotecan in children with relapsed or refractory extracranial solid tumors.
METHODS: This study included children with relapsed or refractory extracranial 
solid tumors treated with cyclophosphamide (250 mg/m2/day) and topotecan 
(0.75 mg/m2/day) for 5 days, 3-weekly, between January 2012 and February 2024. 
Event-free-survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated using the 
Kaplan-Meier method.
RESULTS: Eighteen patients with median (range) age 6 (2-13) years (72% boys) 
with diagnoses of neuroblastoma (61%), Ewing sarcoma (22%), and rhabdomyosarcoma 
(17%), were analysed. Median of 4-cycles of chemotherapy was given, mostly as 
second-line (78%). Among 15 evaluable patients, responses were complete-response 
(CR, n = 1), partial response (PR, n = 3), stable disease (SD, n = 2), and 
progressive disease (n = 9); disease control rate (CR + PR + SD) 40%. The median 
EFS and OS were 3.65 months and 9.72 months, respectively, with 1-year EFS and 
OS rates of 33% and 45%. There was no treatment-related mortality.
CONCLUSION: Cyclophosphamide-topotecan shows efficacy and acceptable safety in 
pediatric relapsed/refractory solid cancers, highlighting the need for better 
strategies to improve outcomes.

Fibronectin (FN1), a vital extracellular matrix protein, has been reported to be 
elevated in blood and cerebrospinal fluid in epileptic patients exhibiting 
recent seizure activity. A transcriptomic study from MTLE-HS patients has 
identified FN1 as a potential gene linked to MTLE. Nonetheless, the function of 
FN1 and the participation of the FN1/α5β1-Integrin/Src kinase signaling pathway 
are yet to be fully investigated in both pre-clinical and clinical 
investigations of TLE. Furthermore, its role in NMDA receptor-mediated 
hyperexcitability in TLE requires investigation. This study evaluates the 
contribution of the FN1/α5β1-Integrin/Src kinase axis in facilitating 
NMDA-induced hyperexcitability in temporal lobe epilepsy. Hippocampal formation 
and ATL tissues from MTLE-HS patients, as well as acute and chronic 
Li-pilocarpine TLE rat models, were examined using qRT-PCR, immunoblotting, and 
ex vivo immunolabeling to evaluate the expression of FN1, α5β1 Integrin, Src 
kinase, and NMDA receptor subunits. To assess the functions of FN1 and Src in 
NMDA receptor-induced hyperexcitability, siRNA-mediated knockdown was conducted 
in TLE rats. Following knockdown, behavioral assessments, molecular studies, and 
in vivo EEG were employed to examine the FN1/α5β1 Integrin/Src axis in 
seizure-related hyperexcitability.In MTLE-HS patients and TLE rat models, FN1 
and Src kinase showed upregulation in both the hippocampal formation and ATL, 
together with increased α5β1 Integrin levels in rats. Elevated Src activity was 
associated with augmented phosphorylation of NMDA receptors. The siRNA-mediated 
knockdown of FN1 or Src diminished NMDA receptor phosphorylation and markedly 
reduced seizure activity in TLE animals. Our research suggests that FN1 has a 
role in MTLE pathophysiology and may regulate NMDAR-mediated hyperexcitability 
via the FN1/α5β1 Integrin/Src kinase pathway. This pathway regulates seizures 
via the hippocampal formation and anterior temporal lobe networks. The 
therapeutic potential of targeting this signaling pathway for epilepsy needs 
additional investigation.

BACKGROUND: Primary malignant chest wall tumors, originating from the bones, are 
infrequent neoplasms. Given its heterogeneity, further research is needed to 
understand the implications of recurrence and related factors in patients 
undergoing chest wall resection.
AIMS: We analyzed the association between the clinicopathological 
characteristics of these patients and their overall-survival (OS) and 
disease-free-survival (DFS).
METHODS:  In this study, we conducted a retrospective analysis on patients who 
underwent chest wall resection for primary malignant bony chest wall tumors 
between 2000-2023.
RESULTS: Fifty-one patients were included. The presence of Ewing tumor, prior 
adjuvant therapy, postoperative complications, and reduced surgical margin were 
significantly associated with DFS and OS in both survival and univariate 
analyses. The optimal surgical margin threshold was identified as greater than 3 
cm. Multivariate analysis revealed that only histopathological diagnosis of 
Ewing tumor and an insufficient margin remained significant for worse DFS and OS 
(p = 0.041 and 0.024, respectively). The 5-year overall survival (OS) and 
disease-free survival (DFS) rates were 53.6% and 50.8%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Ensuring effective surgery of chest wall tumors necessitates a 
surgical margin greater than 3 cm. Furthermore, the histopathologic 
classification of Ewing carcinoma emerges as another determinant impacting DFS 
and OS.

Viruses induce approximately 12% of human cancers, including lymphomas. In the 
case of T/NK cell neoplasms, human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-1) causes 
adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATL), and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is associated 
with extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma (ENKTCL) and chronic active Epstein-Barr 
virus disease (CAEBV). Common mechanisms for lymphoma development have been 
proposed. Viral genes, such as tax and HTLV-1 bZIP factor (HBZ) of HTLV-1, and 
latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) and BamHI A rightward transcript microRNA 
(miRNA-BART) of EBV, contribute to host immune evasion and modulation of host 
signaling pathways, resulting in the persistence of viral-infected cells. This 
viral strategy is closely associated with oncogenesis. Furthermore, the 
long-term survival of infected cells leads to the accumulation of somatic 
mutations and aberrant epigenetic alterations. These events eventually lead to 
ATL, ENKTCL, and the lymphoma-like subset of CAEBV. Interrupting these common 
oncogenic mechanisms is a promising therapeutic strategy for viral-driven 
lymphomas with poor prognoses.

BACKGROUND: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have revolutionized the treatment 
of numerous types of cancer but have also led to atypical response patterns such 
as pseudoprogression, hyperprogression, and mixed responses. These phenomena 
pose methodological challenges to the conventional RECIST 1.1 criteria (Response 
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors), which were developed for cytotoxic 
therapies. In particular, pseudoprogression-defined as initial tumor enlargement 
followed by regression-may lead to misinterpretation and premature 
discontinuation of therapy.
OBJECTIVES: To describe the rationale, structure, and clinical relevance of the 
iRECIST criteria introduced in 2017.
METHODS: The clinical background necessitating adaptation of established 
response criteria is outlined, followed by a detailed explanation of response 
assessment using iRECIST. Finally, an overview of the current evidence on the 
utility of iRECIST for evaluating treatment response under immune checkpoint 
inhibition is provided.
RESULTS: iRECIST is based on RECIST 1.1 principles but introduces the category 
of "unconfirmed progressive disease" (iUPD). In cases of new lesions or apparent 
progression, a follow-up scan after 4-8 weeks is recommended to distinguish 
between true progression (iCPD) and pseudoprogression. While one meta-analysis 
reported only minor differences in objective response rate and progression-free 
survival, other studies demonstrated marked differences across several outcome 
parameters, improved interreader reliability, and better detection of 
pseudoprogression when applying iRECIST.
CONCLUSION: iRECIST provides adapted criteria for assessing treatment response 
under immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. It enables differentiation between 
true progression and pseudoprogression, thereby preventing unwarranted treatment 
discontinuations. Prospective validation in larger cohorts remains desirable.

Publisher: ZUSAMMENFASSUNG: HINTERGRUND: Immuncheckpoint-Inhibitoren (ICI) haben 
die Therapie maligner Erkrankungen revolutioniert, führen jedoch häufig zu 
atypischen Ansprechmustern wie Pseudoprogression, Hyperprogression oder 
gemischtem Ansprechen. Diese Phänomene stellen die konventionellen, für 
zytotoxische Therapien entwickelten RECIST(Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid 
Tumors)-1.1-Kriterien vor methodische Herausforderungen. Insbesondere 
Pseudoprogressionen, definiert als initiale Tumorvergrößerung mit nachfolgender 
Regression, können zu Fehlinterpretationen und verfrühten Therapieabbrüchen 
führen.
FRAGESTELLUNG: Ziel war es, die Systematik und klinische Relevanz der 2017 
eingeführten iRECIST-Kriterien darzustellen.
MATERIAL UND METHODE: Es erfolgt eine Darstellung der klinischen Hintergründe, 
die eine Anpassung etablierter Responsekriterien nötig machten, sowie eine 
detaillierte Erläuterung des Response-Assessments mittels iRECIST (immune 
RECIST). Abschließend wird eine kurze Übersicht der aktuellen Studienlage zum 
Nutzen von iRECIST für die Beurteilung des Therapieansprechens unter 
Immuncheckpoint-Inhibitoren gegeben. ERGEBNISSE: iRECIST basiert auf den 
Prinzipien von RECIST 1.1, erweitert diese jedoch um die Kategorie „unconfirmed 
progressive disease“ (iUPD). Bei neu aufgetretenen Läsionen oder 
Tumorprogression erfolgt eine Kontrolluntersuchung nach 4–8 Wochen, um zwischen 
echtem Progress (iCPD) und Pseudoprogression zu unterscheiden. Während eine 
Metaanalyse teils nur geringfügige Unterschiede in objektiver Ansprechrate und 
progressionsfreiem Überleben nachwies, berichten andere Studien von deutlichen 
Unterschieden in verschiedenen Endpunkten und besserer Inter-Reader-Reliabilität 
sowie Erfassung von Pseudoprogressionen unter Verwendung von iRECIST. 
SCHLUSSFOLGERUNG: iRECIST sind angepasste Kriterien zur Bewertung des 
Therapieansprechens unter Immuncheckpointinhibitor-Therapie. Die Kriterien 
ermöglichen eine Differenzierung zwischen Progression und Pseudoprogression und 
tragen zur Vermeidung ungerechtfertigter Therapieabbrüche bei. Eine prospektive 
Validierung in größeren Kohorten bleibt wünschenswert.

PURPOSE: Despite insurance coverage, cancer patients often face significant 
financial burdens. This study examined how commercially insured cancer patients 
utilize employer-provided virtual healthcare navigation services for financial 
concerns.
METHODS: We analyzed chat conversations between care coordinators and members 
with cancer who used virtual navigation services provided by Included Health 
during 2022-2023-a third-party vendor contracted by employers to deliver 
navigation as an ancillary benefit. Included Health is not an insurance company 
and does not approve claims, determine coverage, or make payment decisions. 
Services included benefits routing, provider search, clinician referrals, care 
management, and expert medical opinions. Using natural language processing, we 
categorized financial discussions into four levels: no financial mention, 
financial inquiry, financial concern, and financial stress. We used chi-square 
and t-tests to examine differences across categories.
RESULTS: Of 18,001 eligible cancer patients, 27.4% (n = 4937) used navigation 
services. The most utilized services were benefits routing (49.9%), self-service 
provider search (42.5%), and care coordinator assistance for finding in-network 
clinicians (39.3%). Among members using chat functionality, 82% raised financial 
matters: 30% made financial inquiries (e.g., coverage verification), 37% 
expressed financial concerns (e.g., insurance payment issues), and 14% reported 
financial stress affecting well-being. The remaining 18% had no financial 
mentions. Members reporting financial stress were more likely to use concierge 
referral services (55.4% vs. 44.1%, p < 0.01), expert medical opinions (18.6% 
vs. 12.4%, p = 0.01), and case management programs (27.9% vs. 17.5%, p < 0.01) 
compared to those reporting financial concerns without impact.
CONCLUSIONS: The high prevalence of financial concerns among commercially 
insured cancer patients using independent, third-party navigation services 
demonstrates that insurance alone does not shield patients from financial 
stress. Members' willingness to discuss financial concerns with care 
coordinators indicates that virtual navigation services can serve as an 
important resource for identifying and addressing financial toxicity in cancer 
care.

We developed a highly sensitive electrochemical sensor based on zirconium-iron 
metal-organic frameworks (ZrFe-MOF) for the precise detection of ultra-low 
abundance miRNA-21. The construction of this sensor, through an innovative 
thermal alkaline activation strategy, exposed abundant binding sites on the 
surface of ZrFe-MOF, significantly improving aptamer (Apt) loading efficiency, 
thereby, achieving unprecedented sensitivity with a wide linear range (100 aM-10 
nM, R² = 0.997) and a record-low detection limit of 19.33 aM - outperforming 
existing methods by 1-2 orders of magnitude. Besides, the biosensor successfully 
discriminates miRNA-21 expression profiles in breast cancer cell lines and 
breast adenocarcinoma (MDA-MB-231 vs. MCF-7 vs. MCF-10 A), showing high 
consistency with qPCR results. This work not only demonstrates a novel 
binding-site engineering strategy for nucleic acid detection but also presents a 
clinically viable platform for early cancer diagnosis with superior sensitivity, 
specificity, and reproducibility. This thermal-alkaline activation strategy 
could be extended to other bimetallic MOFs for multiplex miRNA detection, with 
future efforts targeting sensor miniaturization for point-of-care use. Current 
challenges include balancing the material's electron transfer efficiency with 
long-term storage stability and verifying the sensor's performance in 
large-scale clinical cohort samples.

SALL4 is aberrantly reactivated in multiple malignancies, including breast 
cancer (BC), where it promotes tumor progression and therapy resistance. 
However, its therapeutic targeting remains underexplored. This study 
investigates the antitumor efficacy of a novel SALL4-inhibitory peptide, 
PEN-FFW, and its regulatory impact on the PI3K/AKT/PD-L1 axis and CD8⁺ T 
cell-mediated cytotoxicity in BC. SALL4 expression in BC was assessed using 
public databases and validated in cell lines by RT-qPCR and western blot. The 
interaction between SALL4 and the NuRD complex was evaluated by 
co-immunoprecipitation assay. Functional assays were conducted to assess the 
effects of PEN-FFW in vitro. Co-culture systems were used to evaluate CD8⁺ T 
cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Mechanistic studies investigated the involvement of 
the PTEN/PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling axis. In vivo efficacy was tested in allograft 
mouse models, including combination therapy with anti-PD-L1 antibody. SALL4 was 
significantly upregulated in BC and associated with poor prognosis. PEN-FFW 
disrupted the SALL4-NuRD interaction, restored PTEN expression, and suppressed 
PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling. This led to a reduction in PD-L1 expression and 
increased apoptosis, while inhibiting the proliferation and migration of BC 
cells. PEN-FFW also enhanced CD8⁺ T cell cytotoxicity by reducing PD-L1-mediated 
immune evasion. Furthermore, combination treatment with PEN-FFW and anti-PD-L1 
antibody showed superior tumor suppression and increased CD8⁺ T cell 
infiltration compared to either treatment alone. PEN-FFW is a potent 
SALL4-inhibitory peptide that suppresses BC progression by downregulating PD-L1 
through PI3K/AKT pathway inactivation and promoting CD8⁺ T cell-mediated tumor 
killing. These findings highlight a promising strategy for enhancing 
immunotherapy in SALL4-positive BC.

Allgrove syndrome (AS) is a rare, multisystem, autosomal recessive disorder 
characterized by the triad of symptoms: achalasia, alacrimia and ACTH-resistant 
adrenal insufficiency. Various and nonspecific neurological symptoms can also 
develop over time, "blurring" the typical course of this underdiagnosed 
condition. The incidence of Allgrove syndrome is unknown. Orphanet database 
reports fewer than 100 published cases, but according to the literature review, 
at least 206 patients have already been described. The pathogenic variant 
p.Ser263Pro is one of the most recurrent aberrations affecting the AAAS gene and 
has been reported in several families of Slavic origin. We investigated 
genotype-phenotype correlation in 206 patients with AS described in literature 
(including two novel Polish siblings carrying a homozygous p.Ser263Pro variant 
in the AAAS gene) and found that neurological symptoms were significantly more 
common among carriers of p.Ser263Pro variant (33 out of 34, 97.1%) as compared 
to other AAAS variant carriers (133 out of 172, 77.3%, p = 0.006). While the 
incidence of the classical clinical triad of AS was similar and observed in 110 
out of 206 AS patients (53.4%) and in 18 out of 34 (52.9%) among p.Ser263Pro 
variant carriers. Furthermore, our report supports the hypothesis of a founder 
origin of the p.Ser263Pro variant in AAAS gene in a European Caucasian 
population. Slavic origin was found in 25 out of 36 reported variant carriers 
(69.4%) and 17 out of 23 (73.9%) who were homozygous for p.Ser263Pro variant. 
Summarizing, neurological manifestations of AS predominate in patients carrying 
a potentially founder p.Ser263Pro variant within the AAAS gene.

BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is a heterogeneous malignant disease that remains as 
one of the most prevalent cancers globally. Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) 
accounts for 15% of the total of breast cancers and presents high tumor 
immunogenicity and a tumor microenvironment that plays a critical role in 
disease progression and patient outcomes.
METHODS: This study evaluated a total of 30 tissue samples from female patients 
with TNBC, to characterize specific immune cells within the tumor tissue and 
investigate their relationship with short (pathological complete response, pCR), 
long (disease-free survival, DFS) and clinical outcomes. Tumor-infiltrating 
lymphocytes (TIL) were assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) on tissue 
microarrays (TMA), complemented by digital analysis for standardized 
quantification.
RESULTS: Our results highlight the influence of CD4⁺ T cells on short-term 
outcomes: high CD4⁺ T-cell levels were significantly associated with achieving 
pCR. High CD8⁺ T-cell levels were also significantly associated with axillary 
lymph node negativity.Regarding long-term outcomes, higher CD4⁺, CD8⁺ and FOXP3⁺ 
T-cell levels showed a non-significant tendency toward improved DFS.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that high levels of CD4 + T cells and 
CD8 + T cells are positive predictors of immediate, long-term prognosis and 
clinical prognosis in patients with TNBC. This study enhances the understanding 
on the immunological interests in specific subtypes of TIL and identifies 
potential biomarkers that could drive advancements in precision medicine for 
breast cancer management.

Biased Kappa-opioid Agonist Strategies in Pain Management: Approaches to 
Clinical Benefits with Reduced Adverse Effects.

Mu-opioid receptor (MOR) agonists remain the cornerstone of pain management but 
are limited by respiratory depression, tolerance, dependence, and mood 
disturbances. Kappa-opioid receptor (KOR) agonists offer complementary analgesic 
mechanisms with minimal abuse potential, yet clinical utility is restricted by 
dysphoria, sedation, and anxiety. This review critically evaluates emerging 
strategies that leverage both receptor systems through G-protein-biased KOR 
agonists and bifunctional KOR/MOR ligands. While preclinical evidence suggests 
that these approaches may provide additive analgesia with reduced adverse 
effects, significant challenges remain in translating these findings to clinical 
practice. The controversy surrounding G-protein bias measurement and the limited 
clinical data available highlight the need for cautious optimism regarding these 
novel therapeutic approaches.

Advanced lung disease, cardiovascular disease (CVD), infections, malignancies, 
and thromboembolic disease (TED) determine the mortality of patients with 
sarcoidosis. Our objective was to evaluate the main causes of admission and 
in-hospital mortality in patients with sarcoidosis in Spain. A retrospective and 
observational analysis of the National Registry of Hospital Discharges 
(RAE-CMBD) of patients admitted with a diagnosis of sarcoidosis between 2016 and 
2021 was performed. A total of 18,887 admissions of patients with sarcoidosis 
were identified. The main causes of admission were infection (21%), sarcoidosis 
itself (16.4%), CVD (12.7%), and malignancies (7.1%). Overall, 892 (4.7%) 
patients died, mainly from infection (32.1%), CVD (16.3%) and neoplasms (12.4%), 
with case fatality rates of 7.2%, 6% and 8.3%, respectively. Factors associated 
with higher in-hospital mortality were Charlson comorbidity index (OR 1.30 95%CI 
1.27-1.34), sarcoidosis pulmonary involvement (OR = 1.20, 95%CI 1.04-1.38), 
pulmonary fibrosis (OR 2.07; 95%CI 1.52-2.81) and CVD (OR 1.56; 95%CI 
1.26-1.95), infection (OR 2.37; 95%CI 1.97-2.84), malignancies (OR 1.77; 95%CI 
1.38-2.27) and TE-related admissions (OR 2.1, 95%CI 1.21-3.76). The main 
determinants of hospital admissions and mortality in patients with sarcoidosis 
are infections, CVD, neoplasm, VTE, pulmonary fibrosis, and a high comorbidity 
burden. While sarcoidosis itself is a common cause of admission, it is rarely 
the cause of death. Prevention of infections, VTE, and neoplasm, along with 
control of cardiovascular risk factors, may help reduce mortality in these 
patients.

Acute eosinophilic pneumonia (AEP) is a rare, rapidly progressive respiratory 
disease characterized by diffuse pulmonary eosinophilia. Its etiology, clinical 
course, and prognosis in children remain incompletely understood. We conducted a 
retrospective cohort study at Yuying Children's Hospital, enrolling children 
diagnosed with AEP between January 2014 and December 2024. Demographic, 
clinical, laboratory, radiological, treatment, and outcome data were analyzed. 
Among 31 patients with pediatric AEP, the highest proportion occurred in autumn 
(38.7%). Respiratory infections were identified in 26 (83.9%) patients, most 
commonly Mycoplasma pneumoniae (n = 12) and human bocavirus (n = 4). Passive 
smoke exposure was identified in five patients (16.1%). Children with allergic 
comorbidities (10/31, 32.3%) demonstrated significantly elevated total 
immunoglobulin E levels (median, 742.0 vs. 317.5 IU/mL, P = 0.012), but 
otherwise comparable clinical laboratory profiles. Fifteen patients (48.4%) who 
presented with respiratory failure demonstrated significantly elevated 
procalcitonin (PCT, 0.39 vs. 0.07 µg/L, P = 0.002) and D-dimer levels (1.10 vs. 
0.55 µg/mL, P = 0.015), longer hospital stays (7.0 vs. 5.0 days, P = 0.028), and 
a higher prevalence of pleural effusion (53.3% vs. 18.8%, P = 0.044) compared 
with the non-respiratory failure group. Twenty-two patients (71.0%) received 
systemic corticosteroids. Most achieved full recovery, though asthma (n = 5) was 
observed during follow-up.
CONCLUSION:  Pediatric AEP is primarily infection-driven, with a probable autumn 
seasonality and passive smoke exposure as a potential co-trigger. Elevated PCT 
and D-dimer levels are associated with the development of respiratory failure. 
The overall prognosis is generally favorable, but long-term follow-up is 
essential to monitor sequelae.
WHAT IS KNOWN: •  AEP is a rare, acute hypoxemic disease characterized by 
eosinophil-mediated inflammation triggered by infection, inhalational exposures, 
or medications. •  It responds rapidly to corticosteroid therapy; 
pediatric-specific guidelines are lacking, and existing evidence is largely 
limited to case reports.
WHAT IS NEW: •  Pediatric AEP appears to be primarily infection-driven, with 
autumn clustering and a potential contribution from passive smoke exposure, 
while generally maintaining a favorable prognosis. •  Elevated PCT and D-dimer 
levels are associated with the development of respiratory failure in pediatric 
AEP.

Serum Mas-related G protein-coupled receptor X2 concentration in drug-induced 
immediate hypersensitivity reactions.

Dziadowiec A, Kwitniewski M, Kopac P, Sedlackova L, Srotova A, Koren A, Gluck J, 
Porebski G.

INTRODUCTION: Mas-related G protein-coupled receptor X2 (MRGPRX2) has emerged as 
a mediator of mast-cell activation in acute and chronic conditions. Exogenous 
ligands, such as neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) and fluoroquinolones 
(FQs), can trigger MRGPRX2-dependent activation and may augment immunoglobulin E 
(IgE)-mediated pathways. Although investigators have measured serum MRGPRX2 in 
asthma, mastocytosis, and chronic urticaria, its role in immediate 
hypersensitivity reactions (IHRs) to FQs or NMBAs remains unclear.
OBJECTIVES: We conducted this study to determine whether increased serum MRGPRX2 
concentration is a risk factor for IHRs to NMBAs or FQs and whether 
concentration relate to reaction severity, causative agent, or serum tryptase.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied 43 patients with a history of IHRs to NMBAs or 
FQs and compared them with 50 patients with IHRs to Hymenoptera venom and 40 
control individuals. Participants underwent a diagnostic evaluation that 
included skin testing, specific IgE measurement, and basophil activation test 
when indicated. We measured serum MRGPRX2 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
RESULTS: The median serum MRGPRX2 values with interquartile ranges for the 
drug-induced reactions group, the Hymenoptera venom-induced reactions group, and 
the control group were 7.50 (3.73-15.64), 7.00 (3.96-10.62), and 5.89 
(2.43-9.98) ng/mL, respectively (P = 0.32). Serum MRGPRX2 concentration showed 
no relationship with reaction severity, specific causative agents, or serum 
tryptase.
CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort, serum MRGPRX2 was not a risk factor for the 
investigated drug- and venom-induced IHRs. These findings do not support using 
serum MRGPRX2 as a predictor of reaction occurrence or severity in these 
settings.

Beyond glycemic control, hypoglycemic agents exhibit multifaceted effects that 
may influence pulmonary health in patients with diabetes mellitus. This 
narrative review synthesizes available evidence from preclinical and clinical 
studies on the impact of major hypoglycemic drug classes-including biguanides, 
sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, α-glucosidase inhibitors, DPP-4 inhibitors, 
SGLT-2 inhibitors, GLP-1 receptor agonists, and insulin-on pulmonary diseases. 
Evidence suggests that these agents exert class-specific, and often conflicting, 
effects: preclinical studies support their protective potential in acute lung 
injury, while clinical data indicate variable efficacy in asthma, COPD, and 
respiratory infections including COVID-19. Conversely, some agents may be 
associated with increased risks of lung cancer or COPD exacerbations, 
underscoring the need for context-specific prescribing. Mechanistic insights 
from animal models primarily involve modulation of inflammatory, oxidative, and 
immune pathways. This narrative review aims to provide a clinical framework for 
personalizing hypoglycemic therapy in patients with comorbid pulmonary 
conditions, while underscoring the need for well-designed prospective studies to 
resolve existing controversies.

AIM: This study aimed to evaluate the adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes 
among pregnant women with COVID-19 at King Salman Armed Forces Hospital in Tabuk 
and examine the relationship between the severity of COVID-19 infection and 
these outcomes.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study enrolled COVID-19-positive pregnant 
women. Demographic and obstetric information, clinical characteristics 
(including symptoms and preexisting comorbid conditions), and maternal and 
neonatal outcomes were collected from medical records, reviewed, and analyzed.
RESULTS: The study included 138 COVID-19-positive women, with the majority of 
cases diagnosed in the third trimester (85.5%). Assessment of the severity of 
COVID-19 infection showed that a large proportion were asymptomatic (39.1%) or 
had mild disease (39.9%), while 14.5% had moderate disease and 6.5% experienced 
severe illness. Adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes included preeclampsia 
(5.1%), gestational diabetes (4.3%), placental abruption, premature rupture of 
membranes (2.9% each), maternal intensive care unit (ICU) admission (1.4%), 
preterm births (12.3%), low birth weight (15.2%), and neonatal ICU admission 
(10.1%). Additionally, the incidences of preeclampsia and maternal ICU admission 
were significantly higher in women with severe COVID-19 compared to those with 
milder or asymptomatic cases (p = 0.004 each). Neonatal ICU admission showed the 
highest incidence (33.3%) among severe cases (p = 0.031). Asthma was 
significantly linked to a higher risk of neonatal ICU admission (23.1% vs. 
7.1%). Diabetes mellitus was associated with an increased rate of maternal ICU 
admission (13.3% vs. 0%). Hypertension showed significant associations with 
elevated rates of preeclampsia (35.7% vs. 1.6%), maternal ICU admission (14.3% 
vs. 0%), and neonatal ICU admission (35.7% vs. 7.3%).
CONCLUSION: COVID-19 infection during pregnancy was associated with several 
adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes, including preeclampsia, gestational 
diabetes, preterm birth, low birth weight, and increased ICU admissions. Severe 
maternal disease and existing comorbidities further elevated the risks of 
complications for both mother and newborn.

BACKGROUND: There is increasing concern about children with asthma developing 
progressive lung function impairment. The objective of the present study was to 
identify the best spirometric determinants of subsequent development of airflow 
obstruction (AO) in children with asthma in the clinic setting.
METHODS: We assembled two retrospective cohort studies of children aged 
6-17 years, managed in tertiary-care asthma clinics, with medical and drug 
coverage, and repeated spirometry testing. The primary outcome was AO, defined 
as pre-bronchodilation (pre-BD) forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1)/forced 
vital capacity (FVC) ratio below the lower limit of normal (LLN). Multiple lung 
function parameters, prior to index visit, were adjusted for potential 
covariates/confounders in multivariable logistic regression models, by cohort 
and clinical scenario (≥1 versus ≥2 prior visits with spirometry); cohort 
estimates were meta-analysed using inverse-variance-weighted average.
RESULTS: Of 509 eligible children (mean age: 10 years), 17% subsequently 
developed AO. In patients with ≥1 prior visit, the likelihood of future AO 
independently increased by almost 4-fold (adjusted OR 3.91 (95% CI 2.54-6.01)) 
for every 1 z-score lower FEV1/FVC ratio. In patients with ≥2 prior visits, the 
likelihood of future AO increased by 3.31 (1.98-5.54) for every 1 z-score lower 
FEV1/FVC ratio at the last visit and by 1.50 (1.10-2.12) for every 1 z-score 
maximum between-visit variation in FEV1.
INTERPRETATION: Two spirometric parameters independently increased the 
likelihood of subsequently developing AO, namely FEV1/FVC in the low range of 
normal and high between-visit FEV1 variation, appearing as practical 
determinants of future impairment, before reaching the LLN.

BACKGROUND: Sputum cytology utilising routine dithiothreitol (DTT) processing is 
a well-established method to assess airway eosinophilia. However, the multi-step 
nature of this protocol requires substantial resources, thereby limiting its 
broader clinical applicability. To address this, we evaluated formalin-fixed, 
paraffin-embedded (FFPE) sputum plugs as a simplified method for measuring 
airway eosinophilia.
METHODS: Excess sputum plugs from 113 patients with complex airway disease and 
16 asthma patients on corticosteroid or monoclonal antibodies were fixed in 10% 
formalin and embedded in paraffin (Sputum-Minimising Processing, Maximising 
Clinical Outcomes (SSIMPLE) method). FFPE blocks were sectioned, stained with 
haematoxylin and eosin, and assessed by four blinded observers, who performed a 
differential cell count on 400 total nonsquamous cells. Eosinophil proportions 
were then compared between matched FFPE and DTT-processed sputum slides. Airway 
eosinophilia was defined as ≥2.2% sputum eosinophils in DTT-processed samples.
RESULTS: Of the 113 FFPE slides, 96% were adequate for cellular analysis, with 
90% having matched DTT-processed sputum slides. The SSIMPLE method demonstrated 
excellent interobserver reproducibility (consistency: 0.975; agreement: 0.976). 
Eosinophil proportions obtained from SSIMPLE and DTT processing were 
significantly correlated (ρ=0.9, p<0.0001) and showed agreement (Bland-Altman, 
-0.38±9.51). A cut-off of 2.6% detected airway eosinophilia with high 
sensitivity (85.4%) and specificity (93.0%) using the SSIMPLE method, showing 
strong agreement with the routine DTT method, as indicated by an area under the 
curve of 0.957. Additionally, the method effectively assessed treatment 
responsiveness to monoclonal antibody therapy.
CONCLUSION: The SSIMPLE method is a reliable, noninferior approach to DTT 
processing for detecting airway eosinophilia in complex airway diseases, with 
high reproducibility and strong concordance in monitoring treatment 
responsiveness.

Inflammation is a protective response of the body, but excessive inflammation 
can exacerbate conditions such as acute lung injury and asthma. N-(p-Coumaroyl) 
serotonin (CS) is known to have anti-inflammatory effects. The present study 
aimed to explore the anti-inflammatory effects of CS on lipopolysaccharide 
(LPS)-induced inflammatory responses in macrophages and lung epithelial cells. 
Cellular inflammatory responses and associated signaling pathways were analyzed 
using ELISA, Western blotting and immunocytochemistry. Initial increase in 
cytokine (including IL-6 and TNF-α) and chemokine [including monocyte 
chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1)] levels, nitric oxide formation and inducible 
NO synthase expression in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7 
macrophages, was reduced by CS pretreatment. In addition, CS blocked LPS-induced 
MAPK/NF-κB activation in RAW264.7 cells. CS led to heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) 
upregulation in RAW264.7 cells. In PMA-stimulated A549 lung epithelial cells, 
the increase in IL-6, TNF-α and MCP-1 expression was also attenuated by CS. This 
was accompanied by decreased MAPK/NF-κB activation. Furthermore, CS elevated the 
expression of HO-1 in A549 cells. Collectively, the present study confirmed that 
CS exhibited anti-inflammatory effects in both macrophages and lung epithelial 
cell lines, suggesting that CS may alleviate systemic or lung inflammation.

INTRODUCTION: Sickle cell disease (SCD) and asthma share a complex relationship. 
Although estimates vary, asthma prevalence in children with SCD is believed to 
be comparable to or higher than the general population. Determining whether SCD 
confers an increased risk for asthma remains challenging due to overlapping 
symptoms and the multifactorial nature of asthma. This study seeks to clarify 
the association by assessing asthma risk in children with SCD in comparison to 
their siblings, controlling for potential confounders.
METHODS: A prospective, case-control sibling comparison study was conducted. 
Children with SCD aged 2-18 years seen at our outpatient comprehensive center, 
along with their non-SCD siblings, were determined for diagnosed with asthma 
through clinical assessment by a pediatric pulmonologist.
RESULTS: A total of 576 participants (248 SCD, 328 siblings) were included. 
Asthma prevalence was significantly higher in the SCD group (28.6% vs. 7.6%, p < 
0.001) compared to siblings. In multivariate conditional logistic regression 
analysis, SCD status was the only factor associated with higher odds of asthma 
compared to their respective siblings, after adjusting for age and sex (odds 
ratio [OR]: 7.57, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.47-16.54, p < 0.0001). 
Multivariate logistic regression in the SCD group identified advancing age (OR: 
1.19, 95% CI: 1.11-1.27, p < 0.001), males (OR: 2.0, 95% CI: 1.05-3.9, p = 
0.04), family history of asthma (OR: 5.79, 95% CI: 2.68-12.51, p < 0.001), and 
hydroxyurea usage (OR: 2.11, 95% CI: 1.1-4, p = 0.02) as risk factors for 
asthma. Whereas males (OR: 3.32, 95% CI: 1.21-9.13, p = 0.02) and family history 
of asthma (OR: 2.43, 95% CI: 1.01-5.86, p = 0.048) remained risk factors for the 
siblings group. The inferences did not change even when age was restricted to 
2-18 years in the sibling group.
CONCLUSION: SCD increases the risk for asthma, independent of familial and 
environmental factors. Age-related rise in prevalence highlights the importance 
of regular screening in this high-risk population.

Exposure to excess heat is linked to increased risks of cardiovascular diseases 
(CVD). As temperatures increase globally, it is crucial to examine the potential 
increase in excess heat-related CVD (xHEAT-CVD) burden to inform strategies for 
adaptation. This study aimed to identify the contextual factors associated with 
future xHEAT-CVD burden among older adults across eighty U.S. metropolitan 
statistical areas (MSAs). The MSA-specific xHEAT-CVD risk for adults ≥ 65 years 
was estimated using hospitalization and temperature data from 2000 to 2017, with 
excess heat defined as temperatures above the minimum hospitalization percentile 
(TMHP). Future xHEAT-CVD hospitalizations were estimated using temperature 
projections for 2025-2054, 2045-2074, and 2070-2099 under three climate 
scenarios. Area-level variables were used to identify demographic and economic 
status, health, environment, and infrastructure contexts and derive Urban Heat 
Health Risk (UHHR) scores using confirmatory factor analysis. The associations 
between adaptive capacity (the UHHR scores) and future xHEAT-CVD burden were 
examined. In 2070-2099 under the mildest scenario, 36 more days annually were 
projected to be ≥ TMHP, and xHEAT-CVD burden was projected to increase by at 
least 20.4-fold. Lower adaptive capacity was associated with greater increases 
in future xHEAT-CVD burden, over 9-fold increase per 1-unit increase in UHHR 
score (9.1, 95 % Confidence Intervals: 2.8-15.4). The historical xHEAT-CVD 
burden (2000-2017) was largely driven by the health context, whereas environment 
played a more important role in the future. Our findings suggest that drivers of 
the xHEAT-CVD burden may vary across time. Targeting the areas with the highest 
xHEAT-CVD burden at varying timeframes can help mitigate xHEAT-CVD burden more 
effectively.

Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui Province, China.

This study aims to propose a recurrence risk assessment framework that 
incorporates anatomical severity, inflammatory status, comorbidity profile, and 
treatment adherence, and assist in the early identification of high-risk 
patients and guide personalized postoperative interventions. A total of 152 
patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps who underwent functional 
endoscopic sinus surgery at our hospital between June 2021 and June 2024 were 
retrospectively included. All patients completed a standardized postoperative 
follow-up of 6 to 36 months (median duration: 18.4 months). Based on the 
presence or absence of clinically confirmed recurrence during follow-up, 
verified by endoscopy or radiological imaging, patients were categorized into a 
recurrence group (n = 48) and a non-recurrence group (n = 104). Preoperative 
demographic data, clinical scores, biological markers, and postoperative 
medication adherence were systematically collected. Univariate and multivariate 
logistic regression analyses were performed to identify independent risk factors 
significantly associated with postoperative recurrence. Univariate analysis 
revealed that preoperative Lund-Mackay score, Lund-Kennedy score, peripheral 
blood eosinophil percentage > 5%, comorbidity of asthma or allergic rhinitis, 
and irregular use of intranasal corticosteroids postoperatively were all 
significantly associated with recurrence (P < .05). Multivariate logistic 
regression analysis showed that preoperative Lund-Mackay score (odds ratio 
[OR] = 1.38, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.16-1.65, P = .002), peripheral 
blood eosinophil percentage > 5% (OR = 3.62, 95% CI: 1.78-7.38, P < .001), 
comorbidity of asthma or allergic rhinitis (OR = 2.74, 95% CI: 1.31-5.74, 
P = .007), and irregular use of intranasal corticosteroids postoperatively 
(OR = 2.43, 95% CI: 1.16-5.11, P = .019) were independent risk factors for 
recurrence. Although the Lund-Kennedy score was significant in univariate 
analysis, it did not reach statistical significance in the multivariate model 
(P = .072). A higher preoperative Lund-Mackay score, elevated peripheral blood 
eosinophil ratio, comorbid asthma or allergic rhinitis, and poor adherence to 
postoperative intranasal corticosteroid use were identified as independent risk 
factors for postoperative recurrence in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps 
patients. Furthermore, the composite risk scoring model demonstrated strong 
predictive performance in identifying patients at high risk of recurrence, 
offering valuable guidance for preoperative assessment and individualized 
postoperative management.

BACKGROUND: Pediatric asthma, a chronic inflammatory airway disorder, is 
increasingly recognized for its association with gut microbiota dysbiosis, 
mediated through immune dysregulation and systemic inflammation. Recent 
advancements in multi-omics technologies and the "gut-lung axis" hypothesis have 
propelled this field into a research frontier. This bibliometric study 
delineates global research trends, collaborative networks, and emerging 
directions in pediatric asthma-gut microbiota research.
METHODS: Publications from the Web of Science Core Collection (2000-2024) were 
systematically retrieved using keywords related to asthma, children, and gut 
microbiota. Data from 635 articles (392 original studies, 243 reviews) were 
analyzed via CiteSpace and VOSviewer to map country/institutional contributions, 
author networks, citation metrics, and keyword clusters. Non-English 
publications, patents, and conference abstracts were excluded.
RESULTS: Global output demonstrated exponential growth, with 62% of articles 
published between 2018 to 2022. The United States led in productivity (180 
articles, 28.35%) and citations (10,851), while Canada achieved the highest 
citation impact (121.12 citations/article). Key contributors included Prof 
Stuart E. Turvey (19 articles, 2463 citations) and Prof B. Brett Finlay (140.07 
citations/article). The University of British Columbia dominated institutional 
contributions (28 articles, 149.11 citations/article). The Journal of Allergy 
and Clinical Immunology emerged as the top journal (33 articles, 126.48 
citations/article). Seminal works highlighted early-life gut dysbiosis (e.g., 
reduced Lachnospira and Faecalibacterium) and cesarean delivery's role in asthma 
risk. Keyword clustering revealed 6 themes: disease phenotypes (asthma-allergy 
comorbidity), microbiota dynamics (dysbiosis, short-chain fatty acids [SCFAs]), 
immune mechanisms (T helper 17 cells/Treg imbalance, gut-lung axis), 
developmental exposures (antibiotics, breastfeeding), methodologies 
(metagenomics), and therapeutic strategies.
CONCLUSION: This study underscores a paradigm shift from descriptive microbial 
profiling to mechanistic exploration of microbiota-derived metabolites (e.g., 
SCFAs) and early-life interventions. Future priorities include elucidating 
causal pathways via longitudinal cohorts, developing microbiota-targeted 
therapies, and leveraging multi-omics integration. Despite limitations in 
database scope, this analysis highlights accelerating translation from basic 
research to clinical applications through global collaboration. Researchers 
should prioritize interdisciplinary studies to unravel the 
"microbiome-immune-development" triad and optimize personalized asthma 
management.

BACKGROUND: Existing evidence on the disease burden of smoking is often outdated 
and incomprehensive, particularly in Asia, which plays a pivotal role in the 
global tobacco control community. This study aimed to provide an updated and 
comprehensive estimate of the mortality and morbidity burden associated with 
smoking in Hong Kong.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included adults with smoking status 
information recorded in the Hong Kong Hospital Authority database between 1 
January 2008 and 31 December 2012. Subjects were classified into never-smokers, 
ex-smokers, and current smokers. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. 
Cox proportional hazards regression, adjusted with fine stratification weighting 
and key baseline characteristics, yielded hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs) for each outcome.
RESULTS: Of the 1,571,065 individuals analyzed, there were 14.3% current 
smokers, 11.9% ex-smokers, and 73.8% never-smokers. After a median follow-up of 
11.7 years, 61,198 current smokers, 45,918 ex-smokers, and 220,947 never-smokers 
died. Significantly higher risks of all-cause mortality were observed among 
current smokers (HR [95% CI]: 1.53 [1.51-1.56]) and ex-smokers (1.33 
[1.31-1.35]) than among never-smokers. Current and ex-smoking were positively 
associated with the incidences of 76 and 60 out of 115 morbidities, 
respectively. Strong associations were observed between smoking and increased 
risks of suicide (intentional self-harm), mental, and behavioral disorders due 
to psychoactive substance use and alcohol use, particularly among current 
smokers. Notably, these risks were higher in females than in males for all three 
outcomes. Additionally, females demonstrated higher risks of all-cause 
mortality, pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and asthma compared 
to males.
CONCLUSIONS: Smoking remains a substantial burden on the healthcare system in 
Hong Kong, which may still be underestimated due to Hong Kong's relatively less 
advanced stage in the tobacco epidemic compared to some Western countries, where 
the full hazards of smoking have already manifested more prominently.

BACKGROUND: The screening tools for respiratory diseases typically involve 
spirometry (for asthma and COPD), CT scans (for interstitial lung disease), 
chest X-rays (for pneumonia and tuberculosis), and sputum analysis (for 
tuberculosis).
METHODS: This work examines a diagnostic approach whereby a subject's chest is 
radio-exposed to non-ionizing 6G/WiFi multi-carrier radio signals at a frequency 
of 5.23 GHz. The fact that each respiratory disease modulates the amplitude, 
frequency, and phase of each radio frequency differently allows us to screen for 
five respiratory diseases: asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 
interstitial lung disease, pneumonia, and tuberculosis. We collect a new dataset 
(OFDM-Breathe) from 220 individuals in a hospital setting, including 190 
patients and 30 healthy controls. The dataset contains over 26,000 s of radio 
signal recordings across 64 frequencies. Several machine learning and deep 
learning models are evaluated to classify disease type based on the 
discriminatory signatures of radio signals.
RESULTS: We learn that a vanilla convolutional neural network achieves 98% 
accuracy in differentiating between the five respiratory diseases, along with 
strong performance in precision, recall, and F1-score. An ablation study 
demonstrates that reliable screening with up to 96% accuracy is possible using 
only eight frequencies, representing just 12.5% of the total bandwidth and 
leaving 87.5% available for 6G/WiFi data communication.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed method could enable real-time respiratory disease 
screening, could help realize the health equity in developing countries, and 
lays the groundwork for 6G/WiFi-enabled integrated sensing and communication 
platforms for healthcare systems of the future.

Plain Language Summary: This study explores a non-ionizing, contactless 
screening method for five prevalent lung diseases using 6G/WiFi radio signals 
(to complement the conventional methods such as chest X-rays, spirometry, CT 
scans). It leverages the fact that each lung disease leads to an abnormal 
breathing pattern which in turn alters the reflected signals in a unique way. 
Data from 220 individuals (both healthy and patients) were collected in a 
clinical setting, and AI models were trained to distinguish between 
disease-specific patterns. The approach demonstrated high accuracy in detecting 
respiratory conditions and holds promise as a low-cost diagnostic tool, 
especially in remote or resource-limited settings (such as in developing 
countries). The findings also highlight the potential of 6G/WiFi signals for 
broader health diagnostics.

Chronic respiratory diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD), asthma, pneumoconiosis, interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pulmonary 
sarcoidosis, are major global causes of mortality and morbidity. Although the 
COVID-19 pandemic has influenced acute respiratory health, its impact on chronic 
respiratory conditions remains unclear. We estimated the global, regional and 
national burden of chronic respiratory diseases from 1990 to 2023, including 
risk factors, and evaluated how these burdens have shifted during the COVID-19 
pandemic using the Global Burden of Disease Study 2023. In 2023, chronic 
respiratory diseases accounted for 569.2 million (95% uncertainty interval (UI), 
508.8-639.8) cases and 4.2 million (3.6-5.1) deaths. The age-standardized death 
rate declined by 25.7% globally from 1990 to 2023 despite an increase in ILD and 
pulmonary sarcoidosis. Mortality declined in younger males, especially for 
asthma, whereas older adults experienced a rise in ILD and pulmonary 
sarcoidosis. Smoking was the primary risk factor for COPD, whereas high body 
mass index and silica exposure were key risk factors for asthma and 
pneumoconiosis. During the pandemic, the incidence of chronic respiratory 
diseases increased modestly, but the decline in mortality rates became more 
pronounced, highlighting the need for sustained global attention and action to 
address their long-term burden.

Allergies have been linked to immune dysfunction, genetics, and environmental 
factors. However, environmental exposures are often highly correlated similar to 
genetic predictors making the cumulative assessment of exposures difficult. 
Here, we aim to investigate the relative contribution of genetic variants as 
well as different individual and environmental factors on the presence or 
absence of allergies in 450 elderly German women enrolled in the SALIA cohort 
study living in the Ruhr area by using genetic risk score (GRS) and exposomal 
risk scores (ERS). We used the novel cross leverage scores (CLS) to select 
genetic variants to be included in the GRS. The weights of the risk scores were 
obtained through bootstrapped and cross-validated ridge regression. We 
characterized the relative contributions of the risk scores to presence of 
allergies such as atopic dermatitis, asthma, or allergic rhinitis using 
McFadden's Pseudo R-squared. Overall, our model was able to explain 11.13% of 
the variance of allergy diagnosis. The modest variance explained is consistent 
with prior work on complex polygenic and environmentally influenced traits, 
reflecting that no single exposure or domain is likely to fully capture 
individual risk. The GRS had the highest relative contribution at 3.80%, 
followed by the meteorological risk score with 1.13%. This method can easily be 
adapted to other diseases and can facilitate health risk assessments of 
exposomal factors. In addition, the results may aid policy-making, for example, 
by regulating specific sources of exposure.

OBJECTIVE: Anxiety affects up to one-third of adults with asthma and is linked 
to poorer disease outcomes and reduced quality of life. This study evaluated the 
efficacy of therapist-guided, internet-delivered cognitive behavioural therapy 
(ICBT) versus treatment as usual plus medical education for reducing 
asthma-related anxiety.
METHODS: A randomised controlled trial was conducted including 90 adult 
participants with anxiety related to asthma. ICBT was therapist-guided and 
lasted 8 weeks. The primary outcome, the Catastrophising about Asthma Scale, was 
assessed from pretreatment to the primary endpoint at 16 weeks. Secondary 
outcomes included asthma control, avoidance behaviour and quality of life. 
Forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) was collected using a digital spirometer.
RESULTS: ICBT demonstrated a significantly larger reduction in catastrophising 
about asthma than the control group (mean difference -18.53, 95% CI -25.54 to 
-11.53, p<0.001). Asthma control, avoidance behaviour, quality of life and other 
key outcomes improved significantly more in the ICBT group compared with 
controls. No changes in FEV1 were observed. Improvements were sustained at 6 
months follow-up.
CONCLUSION: ICBT effectively and safely reduces catastrophising about asthma, 
improves asthma control, avoidance behaviour and quality of life and represents 
a promising adjunct to routine medical care for patients with asthma complicated 
by anxiety.

BACKGROUND: The relationship of social determinants of health (SDOH), 
environmental exposures and medical history to lung function trajectories is 
underexplored. A better understanding of these relationships could inform 
preventive strategies for lung health.
METHODS: We analysed data from COPDGene, a US longitudinal, observational study. 
Participants were tobacco-exposed (≥10 pack-years of smoking) non-Hispanic Black 
and non-Hispanic White adults aged 45-80 years. We analysed 2990 males and 2945 
females, using Bayesian trajectory modelling on post-bronchodilator forced 
expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC). We 
applied multinomial logistic regression to assess the association of SDOH, 
environmental exposures and medical history with lung function trajectories.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Six trajectories were identified within each sex. 
Non-Hispanic Black race was more prevalent in trajectories characterised by 
lower FEV1 and FVC values (ie, lower lung function trajectories) compared with 
non-Hispanic White adults. In adjusted models, non-Hispanic Black race, 
residence in the Southeastern USA, lifetime asthma and a father with COPD were 
associated with significantly higher odds of the lowest trajectory (ie, 
trajectory six vs the reference trajectory) for both sexes. Higher income and 
private insurance showed inverse associations with lower lung function 
trajectories. The Social Vulnerability Index socioeconomic theme (based on 
census-level poverty, unemployment, income and educational attainment) was 
associated with the lowest trajectory in males.
CONCLUSIONS: Significant disparities in lung function trajectories exist between 
non-Hispanic Black adults and non-Hispanic White adults. Individual- and 
community-level factors are associated with lower lung function trajectory in 
people exposed to tobacco.

Wheeze is a common paediatric winter presentation, requiring bronchodilator 
therapy. Use of jet nebulisers (JN) is currently standard practice, but 
vibrating mesh nebulisers (VMN) have demonstrated quicker, quieter and more 
effective drug delivery, with reduced emergency department (ED) length of stay 
(LOS) in adults. A retrospective review of JN versus VMN use was conducted in a 
paediatric population (n=38 and n=19, respectively). An apparent reduction in ED 
LOS, nebuliser requirement and respiratory rate was seen with VMN use, 
indicating the potential for this device to improve the effectiveness of 
bronchodilator administration and warranting further investigation in paediatric 
patients.

BACKGROUND: Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is a highly effective intervention for 
people with chronic respiratory disease; however, it is not known how best to 
sustain its benefits. Clinical trials are needed to establish if participation 
in singing for lung health (SLH) groups following PR will improve health-related 
quality of life, healthcare utilisation and exercise capacity compared with 
usual care. A feasibility study would help to guide development of these trials.
METHODS: In a multicentre, mixed-methods randomised controlled feasibility 
trial, PR participants at four sites were prescreened at baseline assessment. An 
SLH taster session was included routinely as part of the PR programmes. Eligible 
PR completers were invited to take part in the trial and randomised to usual 
care or a 12-week SLH course. Feasibility outcomes included recruitment rate, 
intervention compliance (at least 8/12 sessions) and health economic analysis. 
Interviews with participants and study personnel were undertaken and thematic 
analysis of the results was completed.
RESULTS: Between October 2022 and November 2023, 1311 patients were assessed to 
start PR, 838 completed. Of those completing, 243 were ineligible to take part 
(predominantly due to vaccination status and excluded diagnoses for PR 
referral), and 531 declined. 64 people (33 female, mean (SD) age 69 (12), 41 
ethnically white, 33 with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 16 with asthma, 
9 with interstitial lung disease, 6 with bronchiectasis) were recruited, with 30 
(93.8%) SLH and 29 (90.6%) controls completing the study. 20 (62.5%) of the SLH 
group completed at least 8/12 SLH sessions. There was enthusiasm for a 
definitive trial from participants, clinicians and singing group leaders' 
perspectives, based on positive experiences of trial involvement. Improvements 
to recruitment strategy, intervention structure, outcome measures and staffing 
were suggested.
CONCLUSIONS: A definitive randomised controlled trial of SLH post-PR appears 
feasible, with acceptable uptake and completion rates.

Trends and Associations of Chest Radiography Utilization in Children With Asthma 
Exacerbations.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Chest radiographs (CXRs) are often obtained among 
children presenting to the emergency department (ED) with an asthma 
exacerbation, despite guidelines recommending against their routine use. The 
clinical consequences and hospital-level variation of this practice remain 
unclear. This study's objective was to assess trends, interhospital variation, 
and factors associated with CXR utilization for asthma exacerbations across US 
pediatric EDs.
METHODS: Using the Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS), we identified ED 
encounters for children aged 2 to 18 years with asthma between 2016 and 2024. 
Asthma exacerbations were identified using a combination of a discharge 
diagnosis code for asthma and receipt of albuterol during the ED encounter. We 
evaluated CXR trends, patient/hospital-level predictors, and downstream outcomes 
using multivariable logistic regression models.
RESULTS: CXRs were obtained in 145 059 children (22.3%). No significant temporal 
trend in overall CXR use was observed; however, CXR use declined among the 
subset of children diagnosed with pneumonia. Rates varied widely across 
hospitals (13.1%-37.7%). Higher CXR use was associated with younger age, female 
sex, white race, private insurance, and winter presentation. Hospitals with 
higher imaging rates had more pneumonia diagnoses and 3-day return visits but 
similar admissions, length of stay, and charges.
CONCLUSIONS: CXR utilization in pediatric asthma exacerbations is common, highly 
variable, and linked to increased pneumonia diagnoses and return visits. 
Persistent low-value imaging suggests hospital-level practices may influence 
diagnostic labeling and patient outcomes. Targeted interventions, such as 
decision support and benchmarking, are needed to reduce unnecessary imaging and 
promote equitable, evidence-based care in pediatric EDs.

BACKGROUND: Siraitiae Fructus (SF), a well-known medicinal and edible herb, is 
traditionally used for heat-dissipation, lung-moistening, and constipation 
relief. However, the active substances and mechanisms responsible for these 
effects remain incompletely understood. Our previous study has shown that 
Siraitiae Fructus total saponins (SFTS) are the effective components in SF.
PURPOSE: To systematically investigate the multi-target mechanisms of SFTS and 
its characteristic compound, Mogroside V (MV).
METHODS: A novel model of allergic asthma with comorbid functional constipation 
(AFC) and gut microbiota depletion, AMPK inhibitor administration, and MyD88 
knockout mice were employed in this study.
RESULTS: SFTS alleviated asthma and constipation symptoms by modulating gut 
microbiota and SCFAs, suppressing the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB pathway, activating the 
AMPK pathway, and rebalancing Th1/Th2 and Th17/Treg ratios. Collectively, SFTS 
restored immune homeostasis and physiological function in the lung and gut. This 
study further identified the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB pathway as a critical mechanism 
for overall effects, while AMPK activation specifically mediated constipation 
relief. Predictably, SFTS showed broader efficacy than MV.
CONCLUSION: This study is the first to employ a pulmonary-gastrointestinal 
comorbidity model to reveal the multi-target and multi-pathway mechanisms of 
SFTS. These findings fill a critical gap in the understanding of the 
multi-mechanism of SF, providing a novel theoretical foundation for its clinical 
application and product development.

BACKGROUND: People with cystic fibrosis (pwCF) are susceptible to chronic lung 
infections, particularly with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. During infection, a subset 
of patients develop cloaking antibodies (cAb) specific to O-antigen 
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) that impair complement-mediated bactericidal killing. 
These antibodies associate with worse disease and their removal via 
plasmapheresis has been used as a successful treatment for multi-drug-resistant 
P. aeruginosa. Whether a similar mechanism of antibody-mediated serum resistance 
exists towards common polysaccharide antigen (CPA) LPS is unknown.
METHODS: Forty-two serum samples and 63 matched P. aeruginosa isolates were 
collected from pwCF. The titres of antibodies specific to CPA in patient sera 
were determined, and the ability of these antibodies to inhibit serum-mediated 
killing of P. aeruginosa was assessed.
RESULTS: Despite widespread anti-CPA antibodies, only one serum-strain pair 
showed evidence of complement inhibition. Patient serum IgG and IgA responses to 
CPA were elevated in 86% and 69% of sera, respectively. Further, 69% of pwCF 
were colonised with CPA-expressing isolates. Despite high prevalence of elevated 
anti-CPA antibodies, only one patient had antibodies capable of inhibiting 
complement killing of their cognate P. aeruginosa. This isolate, CFP3A, had 
significantly higher expression of CPA than all other strains. 
Complement-mediated killing towards it was inhibited by anti-CPA antibodies in a 
titre dependent manner.
CONCLUSION: This investigation reveals that although antibody specific for CPA 
is prevalent in pwCF, it cannot inhibit complement-killing of the majority of 
CPA expressing strains. Thus, when treating Pseudomonas by removing cloaking 
antibodies, it is unlikely that CPA-specific antibodies will also need to be 
eliminated.

BACKGROUND: Asthma is a prevalent chronic condition in children, and is often 
not sufficiently controlled. Children and parents may have a different 
interpretation of the level of asthma control, which can lead to suboptimal 
treatment. This systematic review aims to synthesize literature regarding 
concordance between children and their parents in the perception of asthma 
control.
METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted in EMBASE, MEDLINE, Web of 
Science, and Google Scholar up to February 5, 2025. Studies were included if 
they involved children aged 4-18 with asthma and their parents, assessed asthma 
control using questionnaires validated for children or derived from guidelines, 
and compared results of children and their parents. All healthcare settings were 
included. Four reviewers independently screened the studies and two extracted 
the data. Methodological quality was assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale.
RESULTS: Nine publications were included, with a total of 1,693 children and 
1,693 parents. Various questionnaires and guidelines were used to assess asthma 
control. The quality of the majority of the studies was rated satisfactory or 
good. The agreement between children and parents ranged from weak to very good. 
In many cases, there was a significant difference between the answers of the 
children and their parents: children often perceived their asthma to be less 
controlled compared to their parents.
DISCUSSION: The perception of asthma control is frequently discordant between 
children and parents, with children often reporting lower levels of asthma 
control. These findings highlight the importance and potential beneficial 
effects of shared decision-making between children, caregivers, and healthcare 
providers in improving treatment outcomes.

Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Access to Advanced Therapies for Atopic 
Dermatitis in the United States.

Abuabara K, Bunick CG, Lee LW, Grada A, Calimlim B, Mora AG, Cizenski J, Simpson 
B, Obi C, Goldberg R, Knapp KD, Munoz B, Perez AD, Crawford JM, Silverberg JI.

BACKGROUND: Atopic dermatitis (AD) disproportionately affects diverse patient 
populations, and complex factors influence access to treatment among different 
racial and ethnic groups.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess racial and ethnic differences in AD 
severity and access to treatment in clinical practice.
METHODS: The study included patients aged 6 and older with AD enrolled in 
TARGET-DERM AD, an observational, longitudinal study utilizing electronic 
medical records from 43 academic and community centers across the United States.
RESULTS: The analysis included 1,928 participants: 577 children (30%) and 1,351 
adults (70%), with 42% identifying as Non-White. Non-Hispanic (NH) Asian 
participants exhibited the highest percentage of moderate-to-severe AD at 63%, 
followed by NH-Black (61%), Hispanic (49%), and NH-White (48%) participants. 
Over half (56%) of NH-Asian patients reported comorbid asthma. NH-Black and 
Hispanic individuals were less likely to receive advanced systemic therapies 
compared to NH-White individuals, with odds ratios of 0.71 and 0.66, 
respectively, both statistically significant (P&lt;0.01).
CONCLUSION: Despite having moderate-to-severe AD, NH-Black and Hispanic patients 
had significantly lower odds of receiving advanced systemic therapy compared to 
NH-White patients, highlighting potential disparities in access to advanced 
treatments for AD. &nbsp.

INTRODUCTION: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis during infancy has 
the potential to progress to recurrent wheezing and asthma. However, studies 
evaluating lung function using tidal breath analysis in this age group are 
limited.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess lung function in infants hospitalized 
during their first episode of acute RSV bronchiolitis using tidal breath 
analysis, to compare tidal breathing parameters between the acute phase and 2 
months after clinical recovery, and to evaluate the impact of bronchiolitis 
severity on lung function.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A total of 78 infants aged 1-12 months were enrolled in 
this prospective study; 39 diagnosed with RSV bronchiolitis and 39 age-and 
sex-matched healthy controls. Lung function was measured using tidal breath 
analysis during hospitalization for the acute episode and re-evaluated 2 months 
after recovery.
RESULTS: The ratio of time to peak tidal expiratory flow to expiratory time 
(tPTEF/tE) was significantly lower in the RSV bronchiolitis group than in 
healthy controls, and remained significantly reduced at the 2-month follow-up 
[19.2% (14.9-24.2) vs. 31.4% (28.7-35.3), p < 0.01]. No significant changes in 
tidal breath analysis parameters were observed between the acute phase and two- 
months after recovery. In the severe subgroup, both tPTEF and tPTEF/tE values 
were lower than in the mild and moderate subgroups.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that expiratory airway obstruction may persist 
despite clinical recovery in infants following RSV bronchiolitis. The lack of 
improvement in tidal breathing parameters, particularly tPTEF and tPTEF/tE, 
highlights the need for long-term follow-up. Moreover, greater disease severity 
was associated with more sustained impairment in lung function. These findings 
emphasize the importance of early detection, long-term monitoring, and 
preventive strategies to reduce the long-term respiratory consequences of RSV 
infection.

OBJECTIVE: Home environmental asthma assessment and trigger management are 
critical in pediatric asthma care, particularly in underserved rural areas. 
However, in-person home assessments are often logistically, financially, and 
culturally challenging. This study developed a video-based virtual simulation 
designed to train nursing students and community health workers (CHWs) to 
conduct remote (virtual) asthma home environmental assessments.
METHODS: It was developed at Samford University's Experiential Learning and 
Simulation Center, guided by the NLN/Jeffries Simulation Theory. The authors 
established clear learning objectives, designed the simulation, created a 
scenario, and incorporated structured pre- and post-simulation debriefings. Key 
environmental triggers, selected from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
Home Environmental Assessment Checklist, included dust, mold, cigarette smoke, 
cleaning supply irritants, pets, and pests, all of which were represented in the 
simulation lab. The recorded simulation was distributed to simulation education 
partners and practicing asthma educators (AE-Cs) for expert evaluation using a 
standardized feedback form to refine the program. The simulation was developed 
and evaluated between January and May 2024.
RESULTS: A total of 12 experts in nursing education, asthma education, and 
simulation reviewed the simulation. Their average ratings were: learning 
objectives 4.73, content clarity 4.95, engagement 4.53, realism 4.65, 
effectiveness in promoting learning 4.8, and technology utilization 4.9. The 
overall evaluation score was 4.9 out of 5.
CONCLUSION: Expert evaluation indicated high content validity and strong 
perceived educational value for preparing nursing students and CHWs to conduct 
remote asthma home environmental assessments. Further research is needed to 
evaluate learner outcomes.

AIM: Interleukin 5 is an important target for the treatment of 
eosinophil-associated diseases including eosinophilic asthma. SHR-1703 is an 
innovative humanized anti-interleukin-5 monoclonal antibody designed to improve 
asthma control. This study aimed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, 
pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of SHR-1703 in asthma patients.
METHODS: In the single ascending dose study, eligible patients were randomized 
to receive SHR-1703 (400 or 600 mg) or placebo and followed up to Day 281. 
Primary endpoints were safety and tolerability.
RESULTS: Most treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were mild or moderate. 
The incidence of TEAEs was comparable between the SHR-1703 and placebo groups. 
The median (range) Tmax was 13.9 (7.0-14.1) and 10.3 (10.0-14.0) days for 
SHR-1703 400 and 600 mg, respectively. SHR-1703 at 400 and 600 mg has an 
extended mean (standard deviation) half-life of 75.1 (11.1) and 72.6 (12.7) 
days. Meanwhile, SHR-1703 markedly and rapidly reduced peripheral blood 
eosinophils by over 50% in 1 day. The largest mean (standard deviation) decline 
of eosinophils from baseline reached 87.7 (5.8)% for 400 mg and 91.1 (4.7)% for 
600 mg, with the effect sustained over 100 days. The eosinophil levels remained 
below the baseline up to the end of follow-up.
CONCLUSION: SHR-1703 was well-tolerated and showed promising efficacy in 
eosinophilic asthma patients.

Patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) often experience 
limited health literacy, hampering health status assessment via standard 
questionnaires like the Clinical COPD Questionnaire (CCQ). We aimed to develop 
and validate a modified, literacy-sensitive version, the CCQgraphic (CCQg), for 
all patients with COPD co-designed with a large stakeholder group. CCQ items 
were rephrased and complemented with graphics, followed by optimization through 
semi-structured interviews with patients with limited health literacy. In 
adequate health literacy (n = 64) concordance of CCQg and CCQ was 0.88 (95% CI: 
0.82-0.92). Correlation with the COPD Assessment Test (CAT) was 0.81 (95% CI: 
0.70-0.88). Agreement showed a mean bias of 0.22 (95% CI: 0.10-0.34, P < 0.001) 
with higher scores on mental and functional domains compared to the original 
CCQ. Test-retest reliability in limited health literacy (n = 25) was high, 
CCC = 0.93 (95% CI: 0.86-0.97). The majority (88%) rated the CCQg as equal or 
better to the original. The CCQg offers a validated, literacy-sensitive tool, 
narrowing the gap in health status assessment for patients with COPD with 
varying literacy skills.

BACKGROUND: To study the effect of preventive and control measures of the 
COVID-19 outbreak on the incidence of childhood asthma.
METHODS: In this study, the total number of monthly outpatient and inpatient 
visits for childhood asthma in the Second Central Hospital of Baoding City from 
2018 to 2021 was collected, and they were divided into two groups according to 
the period of the visits, namely, before the epidemic outbreak and after the 
epidemic outbreak. We used the Kolmogorov-Smirnov method to detect the normal 
distribution of the data and the t-test or Mann-Whitney U-test to compare the 
changes in the number of cases of childhood asthma before and after the outbreak 
of the epidemic according to the normal distribution of the data. In addition, 
since both respiratory infections and air pollution are significant influencing 
factors for asthma attacks, to clarify the changes in infectious factors and air 
pollutants, we also compared the changes in common infectious respiratory 
diseases and common air pollutants using the same statistical methods.
RESULTS: During the survival of preventive and control measures for the novel 
coronavirus outbreak, although the air concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, sulfur 
dioxide (SO2), and carbon monoxide (CO) showed significant decreases, as well as 
the number of upper respiratory tract infections, bronchitis, bronchopneumonia, 
and bronchiolitis, showed a significant decrease from before, there was no 
change in the number of asthma cases.
CONCLUSION: COVID-19 prevention and control measures led to a reduction in air 
pollutant concentrations and the incidence of respiratory infectious diseases in 
children but did not impact the incidence of asthma in children.

BACKGROUND: Asthma is frequently misdiagnosed because clinic-based tests miss 
its natural variability.
AIM: As part of early stakeholder engagement, we examined primary-care 
healthcare professionals (HCP)' views on using handheld spirometer and 
fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) for home-based diagnostic testing.
DESIGN & SETTING: This is a two-phase mixed-method study. Phase 1 involved two 
focus groups with primary care HCPs in North-West England. Phase 2 involved a 
national electronic survey distributed to primary-care HCPs across the UK.
METHOD: We used Nominal Group Technique in focus groups to identify key 
priorities for home-based asthma strategy, which informed the development of the 
national survey in Phase 2.
RESULTS: Twenty-one primary care HCPs took part in focus groups. Advantages, 
challenges and facilitators for implementing home-based asthma diagnostics were 
identified. A total of 104 primary care HCPs completed all survey questions. 
Respondents represented a wide demographic and practices across all levels of 
socioeconomic deprivation. Only 3% considered home-based diagnostics strategy is 
unlikely to be feasible. The most frequently cited barrier was high device cost, 
while patient engagement and device accessibility were identified as the most 
important enablers. Most respondents highlighted more accurate asthma diagnosis 
as key potential benefits.
CONCLUSION: Home-based asthma diagnosis using handheld spirometry and FeNO is 
generally viewed favourably by primary care professionals based on survey 
findings, though implementation challenges are multifaceted. Success will 
require system-level changes in how home-based testing is delivered and 
supported. The subsequent phase involves evaluation of test feasibility and 
accuracy, followed by assessment of clinical and cost-effectiveness.

BACKGROUND: Benralizumab, an anti-IL-5 receptor monoclonal antibody, induces 
near-complete eosinophil depletion and has demonstrated significant clinical 
benefits in severe eosinophilic asthma (SEA). Real-world data remain essential 
for evaluating its effectiveness outside controlled trial settings.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the clinical, laboratory, and functional outcomes of 
benralizumab over 32 weeks in a real-life cohort of SEA patients in Türkiye, 
following its recent national approval.
METHODS: This retrospective study included biologic-naïve adults with SEA who 
initiated benralizumab between November 2023 and February 2025 and completed at 
least six consecutive doses. Peripheral blood eosinophil count (PBEC), 
clinically significant exacerbations (CSE), Asthma Control Test (ACT) scores, 
and spirometric parameters were evaluated at baseline and week 32. Patients were 
classified as responders (ACT ≥20 and no CSE) or non-responders.
RESULTS: Twenty-four patients (66.7% female; mean age 50.9 ± 13.1 years) were 
included. Median PBEC decreased from 800 (230-2200) to 0 (0-100) cells/µL (p < 
0.001). Median annual CSE frequency declined by 67% (p < 0.001). ACT scores 
improved from 9 (5-24) to 22 (9-25) (p < 0.001). Mean Forced expiratory volume 
in one second (FEV₁) increased from 1719 ± 768 mL to 2165 ± 831 mL (p < 0.001), 
while Forced vital capacity (FVC) showed significant improvement. Forced 
Expiratory Flow between 25% and 75% of the Forced Vital Capacity (FEF 25-75) 
exhibited a nonsignificant trend toward increase. Sixteen patients (66.7%) were 
classified as responders. Responders had higher baseline PBEC, FEV₁, and 
FEF25-75 values. Benralizumab was well tolerated, with only two mild adverse 
events observed.
CONCLUSION: Benralizumab provided substantial improvements in eosinophilic 
inflammation, exacerbation frequency, symptom control, and lung function over 32 
weeks in a real-life SEA cohort. These findings support benralizumab as an 
effective and well-tolerated therapeutic option in routine clinical practice.

BACKGROUND: Consumption of foods high in fat, sugar, and sodium (HFSS) and 
obesity are rapidly increasing in India. Taxing HFSS foods has been proposed as 
one of the policy interventions to promote healthier diets globally. This study 
estimates the effect of this approach on nutrient intake, diet-related disease, 
and associated health and economic burdens in India.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: We use a nationally representative expenditure survey of 
261,746 households, dietary requirements, and food composition tables to model 
individual nutrient intake. Consumer responsiveness to food price changes for 
three income terciles, captured in price elasticities, is estimated using an 
Almost Ideal Demand System model. Longer-term policy impacts are estimated 
through a novel dynamic microsimulation model, Health-GPS. Modelled policy 
outcomes include changes in risk exposures, disease incidence and burden, and 
total health expenditure. On average, 9.9% of total energy intake comes from 
HFSS items, based on the definition by the Food Safety and Standards Authority 
of India's Labelling and Display Amendment Draft Regulations 2022. Applying the 
highest Goods and Services Tax (GST) rate of 40% on HFSS items is associated 
with a persistent average per capita decrease of 0.1705 kg/m2 (95% CI: -0.1709, 
-0.1700) in body mass index and 45.8 mg (95% CI: -45.9, -45.7) in daily sodium 
intake. Over 30 years, this could reduce annual disease incidence by up to 1.72% 
(95% CI: -1.78%, -1.66%) on average and prevent 0.63 million (95% CI: -0.71, 
-0.55) disability-adjusted life years per year from ischaemic heart disease, 
chronic kidney disease, stroke, diabetes, and asthma, reducing total health 
expenditure by US$601 million (95% CI: -624, -578) per year. Larger absolute 
health gains accrue to higher-income individuals, reflecting higher baseline 
HFSS food intake. Given substitution patterns and a price-inelastic demand, the 
tax change is expected to generate a 92.0% (95% CI: 88.2%, 95.7%) increase in 
tax revenue from foods and beverages with only a minor effect on household 
spending (+1.0%, 95% CI: + 0.0%, + 1.9%). This analysis only captures the 
potential health impacts of changes in energy and sodium intakes. In addition, 
it does not model underlying temporal trends in disease incidence beyond those 
due to demographic changes, which would make our health impact estimates 
conservative if baseline disease risks were to increase in the future.
CONCLUSIONS: Higher taxation of HFSS foods could help mitigate rising incidence 
of diet-related diseases and morbidity in India, reduce healthcare costs, and 
serve as an additional source of revenue for the government.

Severe asthma is associated with persistent symptoms, frequent exacerbations, 
oral corticosteroid dependence, and reduced lung function. The emergence of 
biologic therapies targeting type 2 (T2) cytokines, including IL-5, IL-4, IL-13, 
thymic stromal lymphopoietin, and circulating IgE, has changed disease 
management and led to substantial improvement. This approach has also introduced 
the concept of clinical remission (defined as controlled symptoms, no 
maintenance corticosteroid use, no exacerbations, and optimized/stabilized lung 
function) as a potential treatment target. Although some guidelines propose 
remission criteria, no universally accepted definition exists, and reported 
prevalence varies depending on definitions, and therapies, and patient groups. 
Clinical remission has been achieved in approximately one-third of patients 
receiving T2-targeted biologics. Factors associated with achieving clinical 
remission include less severe disease (less symptoms, fewer exacerbations, and 
better lung function), fewer comorbidities (e.g. obesity, anxiety/depression), 
greater T2-disease activity (the presence of nasal polyps and higher T2 
biomarkers), and early treatment response. Azithromycin therapy can also 
contribute to achieving remission in both T2-high and T2-low moderate to severe 
asthma phenotypes. Future perspectives on asthma remission include integrating a 
treatable traits approach, establishing and validating the definition of 
complete remission, and assessing the long-term benefits of achieving remission. 
Complete remission may encompass clinical remission, inflammatory remission 
(normalization of T2 biomarkers), and structural/functional remission 
(resolution of bronchial hyperresponsiveness, mucus plugging, and airway 
remodeling). Standardizing remission criteria will enable the identification of 
predictive factors and facilitate personalized, treat-to-target strategies. 
Early induction of clinical remission may be a promising strategy for optimizing 
outcomes in severe asthma.

This letter provides a constructive appraisal of the methodological aspects of 
Alenezi et al.'s systematic review and meta-analysis examining the impact of 
adenotonsillectomy on asthma control in children. The authors are commended for 
their adherence to PRISMA guidelines and for synthesizing data from a large 
cohort of over 74,000 participants. However, the reliance on observational 
studies limits causal inference, and the interpretation of heterogeneity could 
be strengthened through the inclusion of prediction intervals and subgroup 
analyses. Future research employing advanced statistical approaches and 
standardized outcome measures would further enhance the methodological rigor and 
clinical relevance of this valuable work.

Asthma remains highly prevalent among adolescents, many of whom experience poor 
control despite medical advances. Adolescents are often expected to manage their 
asthma independently, yet may lack the necessary knowledge, skills, and 
autonomy. Existing family-centered frameworks frequently overlook their 
developmental needs. This paper introduces the Adolescent Asthma Self-Management 
Behavioral Framework, which emphasizes cognitive, behavioral, and emotional 
autonomy within social and developmental contexts. By addressing these gaps, the 
framework can advance clinical practice and guide future research toward 
developmentally appropriate, autonomy-supportive, and contextually relevant 
approaches to adolescent asthma self-management.

Precision Medicine in Asthma: The Role of Biomarkers.

Author information:
(1)National Heart and Lung Institute, NIHR Imperial Biomedical Research Centre, 
Imperial College London, London, UK.

Asthma represents a profoundly heterogeneous syndrome underpinned by multiple, 
distinct and overlapping immunopathological mechanisms. Nevertheless, prevailing 
management algorithms continue to adopt a largely uniform, stepwise approach in 
which pharmacotherapy is intensified only after clinical deterioration or 
recurrent exacerbations. Although the advent of targeted biologic agents has 
improved outcomes in severe asthma, the realisation of precision medicine - 
therapeutic selection directed by individual disease mechanisms - remains 
elusive. This is primarily attributable to the limited availability of validated 
biomarkers capable of defining endotypes and accurately predicting therapeutic 
responsiveness. Existing indicators of type-2 (T2) inflammation, including blood 
eosinophil counts, fractional exhaled nitric oxide, and serum Immunoglobulin E, 
provide only partial discrimination between T2 subtypes and are insufficient to 
guide the choice of specific T2-targeted biologics. Furthermore, robust non-T2 
biomarkers are notably lacking. This review provides a critical appraisal of 
current biomarker paradigms and examines emerging molecular and cellular 
candidates with potential to enable precise endotyping. Integration of such 
biomarkers into early disease assessment offers the prospect of delivering truly 
individualised therapy, ensuring that appropriate treatment is instituted for 
the right patient at the optimal time.

The Effects of Obesity on Lung Physiology, the Prevalence and Severity of 
Chronic Pulmonary Diseases, and Inhalation Treatment.

Obesity itself induces macroscopic, microscopic, and functional changes in the 
lungs, potentially making obese individuals more susceptible to acute and 
chronic pulmonary diseases. Apart from direct contribution to the course of the 
disease, obesity-induced alterations of the respiratory tract may influence the 
delivery and efficacy of inhaled formulations. The review examined 
obesity-induced changes in healthy lungs and the link between obesity and the 
prevalence and severity of chronic respiratory diseases. Fat accumulation at the 
tissue and cellular levels, as well as an increased thickness of the smooth 
muscle layer and an increase in the extracellular matrix, caused a reduction in 
lung compliance, resistance, reactance, and lung volumes. Conversely, airway 
hyperreactivity and closure increased, and ventilation/perfusion mismatch was 
observed. Changes in deposition, metabolization, and permeation across the 
respiratory barrier in obese lungs may alter the availability of inhaled drugs. 
Obesity-induced lung alterations may in part explain the higher reported doses 
of the bronchodilators and anticholinergics in obese compared to normal-weight 
asthma patients. Based on the observed changes, formulations with smaller 
particle sizes that require lower airflow may be more effective for obese 
patients with obstructive lung diseases.

The management of multiple sclerosis (MS) in patients with significant 
comorbidities such as severe asthma presents unique therapeutic challenges. We 
report a case of successful combined biologic therapy with ofatumumab and 
mepolizumab in a patient with relapsing MS and pre-existing severe eosinophilic 
asthma, highlighting the feasibility and safety of dual biologic therapy. To our 
knowledge, this is the first report of concomitant use of ofatumumab and 
mepolizumab in a patient with MS and severe eosinophilic asthma, documenting the 
safety of a non-standard combination strategy in a real-world clinical scenario.

INTRODUCTION: Early-life dysbiosis is associated with increased risk of asthma 
development but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Although eosinophils 
have been reported in the developing lung, their contributions to alveolar 
morphogenesis and lung mechanics have not been functionally interrogated.
METHODS: Maternal exposure to antibiotics (ABX) was used to induce early-life 
offspring dysbiosis, and the effects on lung function and development was 
assessed. Similar measurements were made in mice lacking eosinophils due to 
genetic modification, or administration of IL-5 blocking agents.
RESULTS: ABX exposure between Embryonic Day 15 (E15) and post-natal day 28 
(PN28), increased allergen-induced, and baseline airway hyperreactivity (AHR). 
Similar observations were made when maternal ABX exposure was limited to PN10 to 
PN20. Complete characterization of baseline lung mechanics demonstrated 
downward-shifted pulmonary PV loops, increased small airway resistance, 
decreased compliance, and reduced inspiratory capacity at weaning and 14 months 
of age. Consistent with observation of small airway dysfunction, offspring of 
ABX-exposed dams demonstrated significantly smaller alveoli at multiple stages 
of lung development. Examination of recruitment to developing lungs demonstrated 
an exaggerated recruitment of eosinophils at key developmental periods (PN14) in 
offspring of ABX-exposed dams. Mice with fewer eosinophils (through genetic 
knockout, or treatment with anti-IL-5) display altered patterns of lung 
mechanics opposite to that seen in offspring of ABX-exposed dams.
DISCUSSION: These data underscore an underappreciated role of eosinophils in 
homeostatic lung development and suggest that early life modulation of pulmonary 
eosinophil activity has long-term effects on susceptibility to the development 
of chronic lung diseases such as asthma.

Off-label applications of omalizumab: Current insights and perspectives.

Author information:
(1)Department of Immunology and Allergy, Medical University of Lodz, Poland.

Omalizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds free IgE. Consequently, 
it exhibits inhibitory properties against allergic cascades. Over the past 20 
years, omalizumab has been in the market, and studies have shown its strong 
tolerability and safety profile. Since 2003 in the United States of America and 
2005 in Europe, omalizumab has been available to patients as a therapeutic 
option. In Europe, it is registered for the treatment of allergic asthma, 
chronic spontaneous urticaria, and chronic sinusitis with polyps. In the United 
States, it has been registered for the treatment of allergic asthma, chronic 
spontaneous urticaria, and chronic food allergies in children over 1 year of 
age. With a universal target point for most allergic conditions, omalizumab has 
the potential to become the most versatile biological drug for allergologists. 
The literature describes numerous uses of omalizumab as an adjuvant or 
monotherapy for allergic conjunctivitis, systemic mastocytosis, food allergies, 
drug hypersensitivity, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, and allergen 
immunotherapy, among others. In the following publication, we will provide you 
with the current knowledge regarding the use of omalizumab in conditions other 
than those covered by the current product registration.

BACKGROUND: Biologic therapies improve outcomes in severe asthma, but 
eligibility criteria vary globally, influencing the proportion of patients who 
qualify. We systematically reviewed studies to estimate the global prevalence of 
biologic eligibility in patients aged ≥12 years with American Thoracic Society / 
European Respiratory Society (ATS/ERS)-defined severe asthma and the proportion 
eligible for each biologic.
METHODS: Following PRISMA guidelines (PROSPERO CRD42023393897), we searched 
MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials.gov for studies published 
between 2000 and 2025 that reported the proportion of biologic-naïve, severe 
asthma patients eligible for omalizumab, mepolizumab, benralizumab, reslizumab, 
dupilumab, or tezepelumab. Two reviewers independently screened studies, 
extracted data on eligibility proportions and criteria, and assessed quality 
using the AXIS tool.
RESULTS: Ten observational studies, including 3500 patients with ATS/ERS-defined 
severe asthma, met the inclusion criteria. Across all studies, 1770 patients 
(51%) were eligible for at least 1 biologic, though estimates ranged widely from 
24% to 91%, largely reflecting differences in national eligibility criteria. 
Omalizumab eligibility was reported in 8 studies (16%, range 6%-66%), 
mepolizumab in 9 studies (27%, 19%-78%), benralizumab in 6 studies (25%, 
19%-53%), reslizumab in 6 studies (17%, 6%-41%), and dupilumab in 2 studies 
(41%, 37%-75%). No study assessed tezepelumab. Overall, the lowest eligibility 
(24%) was reported in the European IDEAL cohort due to stringent exacerbation 
and biomarker criteria, whereas the highest (91%) was observed in a Canadian 
single-centre cohort using less restrictive national regulatory criteria.
CONCLUSION: Globally, approximately 51% of adults with severe asthma are 
eligible for biologic therapy, excluding tezepelumab. Among available biologics, 
eligibility is generally higher for anti-IL5/IL5Rα therapies than for anti-IgE, 
and appears highest for anti-IL4Rα, although data for the latter remain limited.

BACKGROUND: Despite elevated rates of asthma among Native American children, few 
interventions have been tested on tribal lands.
OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to test whether the Community Asthma Program reduced the 
number of asthma exacerbations on the Navajo Nation.
METHODS: Following 1 year of community engagement meetings on the 27,000-square 
mile Navajo Nation, a 7-year, stepped wedge study was commenced sequentially in 
3 communities, each with its own Indian Health Service medical center and school 
system. Health care staff were trained in evidence-based guidelines for the 
management of childhood asthma. School staff were trained in the American Lung 
Association Asthma 101 and Open Airways for Schools programs. Stock inhaler 
programs were implemented in schools. The primary outcome, asthma exacerbations, 
was defined as emergency room visits, hospitalizations, or oral corticosteroid 
requirement. With the arrival of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
pandemic in the second year of the program, schools and medical clinics were 
closed. All medical visits were conducted through emergency departments. 
Training in the third community was delayed by 1 year.
RESULTS: A total of 439 health care and school staff were trained either in 
person or virtually. Reflecting national trends, the numbers of asthma 
exacerbations fell dramatically during the pandemic. After control for the 
effect of the pandemic, asthma exacerbation visits increased by 53% and routine 
visits increased by 56%.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the impacts of the pandemic and the program on asthma 
exacerbations are difficult to disentangle, the collective evidence indicates 
that that the program led to increased community awareness of asthma and 
increased asthma care-seeking behavior by families of children with asthma.

BACKGROUND: Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) frequently 
coexists with asthma and involves type 2 inflammation. Dupilumab enables 
prednisolone (PSL) tapering and extended dosing intervals in CRSwNP, but the 
impact on comorbid asthma is unclear.
OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the impact of PSL tapering and extended dupilumab 
dosing intervals on asthma outcomes in patients with CRSwNP.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 60 patients with CRSwNP and comorbid asthma 
treated with dupilumab between 2020 and 2023 who reduced oral PSL to ≤1 mg 
within 1 year on dupilumab administered every 2 weeks and then extended the 
dosing interval to ≥3 weeks. Airway outcomes including nasal polyp score, CT 
score, olfactory function, asthma control test, spirometry, oscillometry, 
fractional exhaled nitric oxide, blood eosinophils, serum IgE, and annual 
exacerbation frequency were assessed at baseline, 3 months, and annually up to 3 
years.
RESULTS: Nasal polyp score, CT score, asthma control test and fractional exhaled 
nitric oxide improved within 3 months and remained stable during PSL tapering 
and interval extension. Forced expiratory volume in 1 second and R5 improved 
transiently but gradually returned toward baseline over time. Eosinophil counts 
rose after PSL tapering but subsequently declined despite reduced dupilumab 
frequency. Total IgE and exacerbation frequency remained consistently 
suppressed. Subgroup analyses showed that asthma control improved or remained 
well controlled irrespective of baseline severity or step-down in asthma 
treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with CRSwNP and comorbid asthma, PSL tapering and 
extension of dupilumab dosing intervals were feasible and did not worsen asthma 
control when sinonasal disease remained well controlled.

BACKGROUND: Recent guidelines recommend maintenance and reliever therapy (MART) 
as the preferred inhaler regimen for patients with moderate to severe asthma. 
However, updated asthma action plans (AAPs), specifically tailored to MART, have 
not been developed for the US population.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to design a MART-specific AAP that is accessible, 
pictorial, and low-burden for clinicians to use during time-constrained clinical 
encounters.
METHODS: Together with health communication design experts, we used a 
multiphase, mixed-methods approach involving semistructured interviews with 7 
adult patients with asthma and 6 clinicians at community health centers while 
exploring preferences for AAP content and design. Thematic analyses informed our 
design process, which used the 5E Design Thinking Framework. Our team ultimately 
developed 2 MART-specific AAPs and assessed their readability using a 
Flesch-Kincaid test.
RESULTS: Patients prioritized simple visuals, concise instructions, and clear 
guidance for managing worsening symptoms as key to a new MART-specific AAP. 
Clinicians emphasized the importance of time efficiency when completing AAPs. 
Using this feedback, we developed a 4" × 6" wallet-sized trifold AAP with a 
Flesch-Kincaid grade level of 3.7 specifically tailored for MART.
CONCLUSIONS: Because guidelines endorse MART as the preferred asthma therapy, 
new and updated MART-specific AAPs are important to facilitate optimal asthma 
care. Our team codesigned 2 MART-specific AAPs based on patient and clinician 
feedback.

BACKGROUND: Hippocampal sclerosis (HS) is characterized by neuronal loss and 
gliosis in the cornu Ammonis (CA) region of the hippocampus and is associated 
with epilepsy, hypoxia, and neurodegenerative diseases. In dementia, HS is 
increasingly recognized as a potential biomarker for Limbic-predominant 
Age-related TDP-43 Encephalopathy neuropathological change (LATE-NC). However, 
LATE-NC currently lacks a validated in vivo biomarker. Since HS is detectable by 
MRI, a key question is whether HS could serve as a reliable proxy for underlying 
LATE-NC pathology. This study examines the prevalence and pathological 
associations of HS across neurodegenerative diseases in a large population-based 
brain bank to assess its potential as a biomarker for LATE-NC.
METHOD: Data were analyzed from the Biobank for Aging Study (BAS-GEROLAB) in São 
Paulo, Brazil. Clinical and epidemiological information was obtained from next 
of kin using validated protocols, including the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) 
scale. Neuropathological assessments included morphological, vascular, and 
immunohistochemical analyses for beta- amyloid, tau, alpha-synuclein, and 
TDP-43. HS was defined as ≥70% neuronal loss in CA1 (unilateral). Individuals 
with a history of epilepsy were excluded.
RESULT: Among 1,307 individuals, 36.9% were non-White and 49.7% were women. HS 
was identified in 41 participants (3.1%), with higher prevalence among older 
individuals, women, and those with lower education levels (p < 0.001). HS was 
also significantly associated with hyaline arteriolosclerosis (p = 0.001) and 
diabetes mellitus (p = 0.003) (Table 1). Multivariate analysis confirmed 
associations between HS and LATE-NC (p < 0.001) as well as lacunar infarcts 
(p = 0.031) (Table 2). The positive predictive value (PPV) of HS for TDP- 43 
pathology was 48.8%, increasing to 59.4% among cognitively impaired individuals 
(n = 432) (Table 3). Among individuals with HS but no TDP-43 pathology (n = 21), 
48.4% had Braak-AD stage ≥3, and 64.5% exhibited arteriolosclerosis.
CONCLUSION: HS is relatively uncommon in this population-based brain bank but is 
strongly associated with TDP-43 pathology. However, vascular pathology also 
plays a significant role, particularly in populations with high cardiovascular 
risk. This limits its predictive value for LATE-NC, even among cognitively 
impaired individuals. Given the absence of an in vivo biomarker for LATE-NC, 
further research is needed to determine whether MRI-detectable HS can serve as a 
reliable surrogate marker for LATE-NC pathology, particularly in genetically 
diverse populations with multiple comorbidities.

Combined inhibition of neprilysin and the angiotensin II receptor through 
Angiotensin Receptor-Neprilysin inhibitors (ARNI) has transformed heart failure 
management and is garnering increasing attention in nephrology. This article 
explores the renal role of neprilysin and critically reviews preclinical and 
clinical evidence on the use of ARNIs in CKD, following a "bench to bedside" 
approach. Experimental data show that neprilysin inhibition improves 
proteinuria, fibrosis, and endothelial function, with enhanced benefits when 
combined with RAAS blockade. Randomized Clinical Trials (RCTs) in Heart Failure 
patients (PARADIGM-HF, PARAGON-HF, PARAGLIDE-HF) have demonstrated renal safety 
and potential benefit emerged in secondary endpoints and prespecified analysis. 
The only RCT performed with primary kidney outcome, the UK HARP-III trial, 
confirmed the tolerability of Sac/Val, and reported a significant reduction in 
proteinuria. No clear nephroprotective effect was observed; however, the trial 
design may not have been adequately structured to detect such an effect. On the 
other hand, real-world data indicate that ARNIs have an acceptable risk profile 
when patients are appropriately monitored, as Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone 
System blockers. Moreover, the benefits of the treatment clearly outweigh the 
adverse effects. Therefore, Sac/Val may emerge as a promising therapeutic option 
in nephrology, especially in patients with cardiorenal disease, pending further 
trials to better define its role in CKD.

BACKGROUND: Alport syndrome (AS) is a hereditary kidney disease caused by 
COL4A3/4/5 mutations that lack of effective treatments. Sodium-Glucose 
Co-Transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) have demonstrated renal and cardiovascular 
protective effects in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), however their 
long-term effects in patients with AS and the underlying mechanisms remain to be 
clarified.
METHODS: We conducted a single-arm, prospective study to examine the effect of 
dapagliflozin in patients with AS. In parallel, Col4a3 p.C1615Y mutant mice 
(129S2/Sv background) were used as an AS model to investigate the 
reno-protective mechanisms of dapagliflozin.
RESULTS: A total of twenty-one AS patients were enrolled. After approximately 12 
months of follow-up (12.6±1.2 months), the mean 24-hour urinary protein 
decreased by 29% to 1.25±0.73 g from baseline (1.75±0.90) (p<0.001). The 
estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) showed no significant difference 
compared with baseline (76±28 vs.77±29 ml/min/1.73 m2, p=0.057). In the animal 
studies, dapagliflozin significantly reduced macrophage infiltration and the 
expression of inflammatory cytokines levels in the renal cortex of Col4a3 mutant 
mice. Mechanistic studies showed that STING pathway was activated in the renal 
cortex and tubular epithelial cells from Col4a3 mice, contributing to a 
pro-inflammatory phenotype. Dapagliflozin effectively inhibited STING activation 
and suppressed inflammatory cytokines production in mutant tubular epithelial 
cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Dapagliflozin can reduce proteinuria in patients with Alport 
syndrome and plays an anti-inflammatory role by inhibiting the STING pathway in 
tubular epithelial cells of AS mice.

BACKGROUND: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising tools for 
enhancing public access to medical information, particularly for chronic 
diseases such as atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). However, their 
effectiveness in patient-centered health communication remains underexplored, 
especially in multilingual contexts.
OBJECTIVE: Our study aimed to conduct a comparative evaluation of 3 advanced 
LLMs-DeepSeek R1, ChatGPT-4o, and Gemini-in generating responses to 
ASCVD-related patient queries in both English and Chinese, assessing their 
performance across the domains of accuracy, completeness, and comprehensibility.
METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional evaluation based on 25 clinically 
validated ASCVD questions spanning 5 domains-definitions, diagnosis, treatment, 
prevention, and lifestyle. Each question was submitted 5 times to each of the 3 
LLMs in both English and Chinese, yielding 750 responses in total, all generated 
under default settings to approximate real-world conditions. Three 
board-certified cardiologists blinded to model identity independently scored the 
responses using standardized Likert scales with predefined anchors. The 
assessment followed a rigorous multistage process that incorporated 
randomization, washout periods, and final consensus scoring.
RESULTS: DeepSeek R1 achieved the highest "good response" rates (24/25, 96% in 
both English and Chinese), substantially outperforming ChatGPT-4o (21/25, 84%) 
and Gemini (12/25, 48% in English and 17/25, 68% in Chinese). DeepSeek R1 
demonstrated superior median accuracy scores (6, IQR 6-6 in both languages) and 
completeness scores (3, IQR 2-3 in both languages) compared to the other models 
(P<.001). All models had a median comprehensibility score of 3; however, in 
English, DeepSeek R1 and ChatGPT-4o were rated significantly clearer than Gemini 
(P=.006 and P=.03, respectively), whereas no significant between-model 
differences were observed in Chinese (P=.08). Interrater reliability was 
moderate (Kendall W: accuracy=0.578; completeness=0.565; 
comprehensibility=0.486). Performance was consistently stronger for definitional 
and diagnostic questions than for treatment and prevention topics across all 
models. Specifically, none of the models consistently provided responses aligned 
with the latest clinical guidelines for the following key guideline-facing 
question "What is the standard treatment regimen for ASCVD?"
CONCLUSIONS: DeepSeek R1 exhibited promising and consistent performance in 
generating high-quality, patient-facing ASCVD information across both English 
and Chinese, highlighting the potential of open-source LLMs in promoting digital 
health literacy and equitable access to chronic disease information. However, a 
clinically critical weakness was observed in guideline-sensitive treatment: the 
models did not reliably provide guideline-concordant standard treatment 
regimens, suggesting that LLM use should be limited to lower-risk informational 
subqueries (eg, definitions, diagnosis, and lifestyle education) unless 
augmented by expert oversight and safety controls.

IMPORTANCE: Area-based indicators of social determinants of health (SDOH) are 
associated with higher risk for acquired heart disease, but their impact on 
conditions with a strong genetic etiology, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 
(HCM), is not well understood.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the association of area-based SDOH with clinical 
outcomes in patients with HCM.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This multicenter, prospective cohort study 
was conducted among US adult patients with HCM from 5 sites in the Sarcomeric 
Human Cardiomyopathy Registry (a multicenter prospective registry of patients 
with HCM) who were followed up for a median (IQR) period of 2.15 (0.15-5.82) 
years. Data were entered from 2015 to March 2024, and data analysis was 
completed from March 2024 to June 2025.
EXPOSURES: Patients' residential addresses were geocoded at the zip code level 
and linked to the American Communities Survey to estimate area-based (1) median 
household income and (2) social deprivation index (SDI), which ranges from 0 to 
100, with higher scores indicating a more deprived area.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Multivariate models, adjusting for age at diagnosis, 
body mass index, hypertension, and sex, were used to estimate the independent 
association of area-based median household income and SDI with heart failure 
(HF), ventricular arrhythmias (VA), and an overall composite outcome (VA, HF, 
atrial fibrillation, stroke, and death).
RESULTS: Among 4431 US adult patients with HCM, median (IQR) age at HCM 
diagnosis was 51.3 (38.9-61.6) years, and 1862 patients (42.0%) were female. 
Median (IQR) area-based household income was $80 000 ($60 000-$110 000), and 
median (IQR) SDI was 25 (10-55). Adjusted hazard ratios comparing the lowest 
income group to the highest income group were 2.07 (95% CI, 1.77-2.42; P < .001) 
for HF, 1.31 (95% CI, 0.97-1.78; P = .08) for VA, and 1.52 (95% CI, 1.36-1.69; 
P < .001) for the overall composite outcome. Adjusted hazard ratios comparing 
the highest SDI (ie, more deprived) group to the lowest SDI group were 1.48 (95% 
CI, 1.29-1.70; P < .001) for HF, 1.55 (95% CI, 1.15-2.09; P = .004) for VA, and 
1.36 (95% CI, 1.22-1.50; P < .001) for the overall composite outcome.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this multicenter cohort study, residing in an area 
with lower median household income or worse SDI were each independently 
associated with adverse clinical outcomes in patients with HCM. These findings 
suggest that despite the genetically determined nature of HCM, place of 
residence is associated with patient outcomes.

IMPORTANCE: Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) follow-up can increase 
knowledge of cardiac arrest outcomes from the patient's perspective. Whether 
HRQOL affects long-term survival is unknown.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether HRQOL 3 to 6 months after cardiac arrest is 
associated with long-term survival.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study linked 5 national registers 
with nationwide coverage in Sweden across a 7-year period and included survivors 
of in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) or out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) 
between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2019, with follow-up through June 30, 
2021. Participants were adults surviving at least 90 days after IHCA or OHCA who 
completed follow-up EuroQoL 5-dimension 5-level (EQ-5D-5L) tool questionnaires. 
Analyses were performed December 2 to 20, 2024.
EXPOSURES: EQ-5D-5L level sum score (LSS; sum of EQ-5D-5L dimensions, ranging 
from 5 [no problems] to 25 [extreme problems in all dimensions]), and the visual 
analog scale EQ VAS, 3 to 6 months after cardiac arrest.
MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: Long-term survival up to a maximum of 7 years among 
patients surviving IHCA and OHCA.
RESULTS: In total, 2000 survivors of IHCA (median [IQR] age, 73 [65-80] years, 
66% male) and 1108 survivors of OHCA (median [IQR] age, 69 [59-75] years, 77% 
male) were included. There were 475 deaths among patients with IHCA and 132 
deaths among patients with OHCA. For patients with IHCA, the LSS distribution 
was 394 (20%) for LSS 5, 1034 (52%) for LSS 6 to 10, and 572 (29%) for LSS 11 to 
25. For patients with OHCA, the LSS distribution was 299 (27%) for LSS 5, 637 
(58%) for LSS 6 to 10, and 168 (15%) for LSS 11 to 25. In the IHCA population, 
LSS 11 to 25 had higher hazard of death compared with LSS 5 (adjusted hazard 
ratio [AHR], 2.50 [95% CI, 1.82-3.43]), whereas LSS 6 to 10 did not (AHR, 1.21 
[95% CI, 0.88-1.65]). In OHCA, no associations were found between LSS categories 
and long-term survival (LSS 11-25 vs LSS 5: AHR, 1.41 [95% CI, 0.83-2.42]; LSS 
6-10 vs LSS 5: AHR, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.56-1.39]). In both IHCA and OHCA, spline 
modeling using LSS and EQ VAS as continuous variables showed significant 
increases in hazards of death with poorer HRQOL, although the estimates in the 
OHCA population showed greater uncertainty.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study of patients who survived beyond 
90 days after IHCA or OHCA, poorer HRQOL reported with EQ-5D-5L scores 3 to 6 
months after cardiac arrest was associated with reduced long-term survival in 
both groups, with greater uncertainty for OHCA estimates. HRQOL assessment may 
help guide follow-up care.

IMPORTANCE: Elevated lipoprotein(a) predicts high risk of cardiovascular disease 
among a modest proportion of healthy individuals, an issue that complicates 
screening guidelines.
OBJECTIVE: To examine spline models, clinical thresholds, and percentiles of 
baseline lipoprotein(a) levels as 30-year determinants of cardiovascular risk.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study was conducted among female 
health professionals participating in the Women's Health Study, who were 
followed up prospectively from 1993 to 2023. Women without cardiovascular 
disease, cancer, and other major chronic illnesses had blood samples taken at 
baseline. All individuals with lipoprotein(a) measurements and/or of European 
ancestry with genotype information for the LPA rs3798220 variation were 
included. Data analyses were performed from January through April 2025.
EXPOSURES: Continuously valued baseline lipoprotein(a), lipoprotein(a) clinical 
thresholds and percentiles, and LPA rs3798220 genotypes known to predict 
lipoprotein(a) levels among individuals of European ancestry.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcomes were incident major 
cardiovascular events, coronary heart disease, ischemic stroke, and 
cardiovascular death. Age- and multivariable-adjusted cause-specific Cox models 
were used to calculated hazard ratios for the cardiovascular outcomes. The 
hypothesis was formulated after collection of the data.
RESULTS: A total of 27 748 women with baseline lipoprotein(a) measurements and 
23 279 women of European ancestry with rs3798220 genotype information were 
included (median [IQR] age, 53 [49-60] years), among whom 3707 and 3165 major 
cardiovascular events, respectively, accrued during a median (IQR) follow-up 
period of 27.8 (22.8-29.4) years. Among women with lipoprotein(a) measurements, 
lipoprotein(a) levels above 30 mg/dL or the 75th percentile (31 mg/dL) were 
associated with increased 30-year risk of major cardiovascular events and 
coronary heart disease. Levels above 120 mg/dL or the 99th percentile (131 
mg/dL) were associated with increased risk of ischemic stroke and cardiovascular 
death. Multivariable adjusted hazard ratios for levels above 120 mg/dL vs below 
10 mg/dL or above the 99th percentile vs below the 50th percentile (11 mg/dL) 
were 1.54 (95% CI, 1.24-1.92) and 1.74 (95% CI, 1.35-2.25) for major 
cardiovascular events, 1.80 (95% CI, 1.36-2.37) and 2.06 (95% CI, 1.49-2.84) for 
coronary heart disease, 1.41 (95% CI, 0.93-2.15) and 1.85 (95% CI, 1.17-2.93) 
for ischemic stroke, and 1.63 (95% CI, 1.16-2.28) and 1.86 (95% CI, 1.26-2.72) 
for cardiovascular death, respectively. Among women with genotype information, 
rs3798220 minor allele carriers had a higher risk of major cardiovascular 
events.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Per the results of this cohort study, very high 
lipoprotein(a) levels correlated with increased 30-year risk of cardiovascular 
disease among healthy women. Screening for elevated lipoprotein(a) in the 
general population may be warranted.

INTRODUCTION: Obesity represents a significant public health problem, 
particularly due to its strong association with additional cardiovascular risk 
factors, such as hypertension, insulin resistance (IR), type 2 diabetes 
mellitus, metabolic syndrome (MS) and cardiovascular disease. IR is the 
underlying factor of the relationship between obesity and metabolic 
dysregulation. The identification of IR is crucial for early diagnosis, clinical 
management and specific treatment.
AIM: This study aims to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of the 
Triglycerides/Glucose (TyG) Index in identifying IR and target-organ damage in a 
cohort of patients with essential hypertension.
METHODS: we have evaluated 235 consecutive patients with essential hypertension 
(50.1% men and 49.9% women; mean age 51.9 ± 17.3 years), stratified for body 
mass index (BMI). Biochemical analysis and instrumental evaluation were assessed 
to identify target-organ damage.
RESULTS: Increased BMI was associated with higher values of blood pressure, 
glycaemia and triglycerides. In patients with higher BMI, we observed more 
prevalent target-organ damage, particularly cardiac remodeling (78.3%) and 
higher 24-h urinary albumin excretion (83.7±48 mg/L). The TyG index proved to be 
a stronger biomarker for identifying the development of MS (AUC 0.78) and 
cardiac remodeling (AUC 0.66).
CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that obesity is correlated with a impaired 
hemodynamic and metabolic profile. The TyG index could represent an efficient 
and easy-to-use indicator for identifying both individuals developing MS and 
early cardiac remodeling, especially in normal-weight subjects.

BACKGROUND: Plasma ceramides are recognized biomarkers of cardiovascular risk; 
however, racial and ethnic differences in their levels, as well as their 
association with cardiovascular health (CVH) among African-American populations, 
remain insufficiently studied.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess the association between ceramide scores 
and CVH, as well as atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk, among 
African-American adults, and to compare ceramide scores between African-American 
and White adults.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a secondary analysis of 2 U.S. studies 
including African-American and White adults. Collected data encompassed 
demographics, behavioral factors (e.g., diet) and clinical measures (e.g., 
plasma ceramide levels). Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk was 
assessed using the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association 
(ACC/AHA) 10-year pooled cohort equations, while CVH was evaluated using the 
American Heart Association (AHA) Life's Essential 8 (LE8) scoring system.
RESULTS: Fifty-eight African-American adults (mean age: 54.6 years; 67.2% women) 
and 1,103 White adults (mean age: 64.5 years; 52.1% women) were included. 
Compared with White participants, African-Americans had significantly higher 
prevalence of obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia, but similar 
ASCVD risk (12.8% vs 12.6%; p = 0.65). No significant associations were observed 
between ceramide scores and either LE8 or ASCVD risk in African-Americans. 
Ceramide levels differed by race/ethnicity, with African-Americans showing lower 
concentrations of 18:0 (0.08 vs 0.10 μmol/L) and 24:1 (0.91 vs 1.17 μmol/L) 
species compared with White adults (both p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: No association was observed between ceramide scores and CVH or ASCVD 
risk in African-American adults. Despite having a less favorable cardiometabolic 
profile, African-Americans exhibited lower ceramide levels than White adults. 
These findings suggest that ceramide scores may not accurately reflect 
cardiovascular risk in African-American populations.

BACKGROUND: Fasting, practiced in clinical, cultural, and faith-based contexts, 
has emerged as a non-pharmacological strategy capable of modulating multiple 
physiological systems. Contemporary evidence suggests that diverse fasting 
patterns (intermittent and time-restricted fasting, Ramadan fasting, 
alternate-day and periodic fasting, dry fasting, and fasting-mimicking diets) 
converge on shared metabolic-circadian-immune pathways and can be conceptualized 
within an integrated resilience framework.
AIM: This narrative review synthesizes current experimental and human data on 
fasting as a multisystem health modulator, linking metabolic, cardiovascular, 
immune, gut-liver-microbiome, neurocognitive, endocrine, and psychospiritual 
effects to common regulatory axes, particularly the Metabolic-Circadian-Immune 
(MCI) and Energy-Information-Resilience (EIR) models.
RESULTS: Across fasting modalities, activation of energy-sensing pathways 
(AMPK-SIRT1-mTOR), metabolic switching to lipolysis and ketogenesis, enhanced 
autophagy/mitophagy, and improved insulin sensitivity have been shown to support 
the management of obesity, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and 
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Fasting also modulates immune and 
inflammatory tone, reshapes the gut microbiome, and may benefit autoimmune 
conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis. Cardiovascular, 
endocrine, and neurocognitive domains show improvements in blood pressure, lipid 
profiles, neurotrophic signaling, mood, and cognitive resilience, while 
structured religious fasting (e.g., Ramadan) can additionally reinforce 
psychological discipline and spiritual well-being. At the same time, responses 
are heterogeneous, and prolonged or intensive regimens may pose risks in 
vulnerable populations.
CONCLUSION: Fasting can be viewed as a low-cost, multidimensional 
"biopsychospiritual" health intervention acting through interconnected 
metabolic, circadian, immune, and neurobehavioral pathways. By integrating 
traditional and religious fasting practices with contemporary mechanistic and 
clinical data, this review highlights shared energy- and immune-regulatory axes 
and underscores the potential of fasting within integrative, preventive, and 
personalized care. Standardized protocols, long-term outcomes, and multimodal 
trials combining immunophenotyping, microbiome/metabolomic profiling, and 
neuroimaging remain priorities for future research.

PURPOSE: To investigate wavefront aberrations, as well as corneal optical 
densitometry (COD), in eyes with epithelial basement membrane dystrophy (EBMD) 
and the influence on visual acuity.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 70 eyes of 70 patients (mean age 
55.9 ± 14.0 years) with the central cornea involving EBMD were compared to 50 
healthy eyes of 50 patients (mean age 58.8 ± 14.1 years) serving as controls. 
Wavefront aberrations of the anterior corneal surface and the total cornea were 
measured with the Pentacam AXL (Oculus Optikgeräte GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany), and 
calculated for the 6 mm central corneal zone. In addition, the COD (corneal 
light backscatter measured in grey scale units) of the anterior 120 µm of the 
central 0-2 mm, 2-6 mm, and 6-10 mm of the cornea was evaluated. Corrected 
distance visual acuity (CDVA) was correlated with wavefront aberrations and COD 
using Spearman correlation analysis.
RESULTS: EBMD resulted in significant higher peak-to-valley (PTV; median: 15.0 
[interquartile range: 9] µm), square root of the sum of the squared higher-order 
aberrations (RMS-HOA; 0.77 [0.52] µm), astigmatism (1.06 [1.04] µm), coma (0.41 
[0.44] µm), and trefoil (0.28 [0.40] µm) (all p ≤ 0.01). A moderate correlation 
was found especially between CDVA and PTV as well as RMS-HOA. EBMD led to a 
statistically significant higher COD (p < 0.01) in the central corneal 6-mm and 
correlated moderately with CDVA outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed a significant correlation between elevated 
wavefront aberrations and backscattering in eyes affected by epithelial basement 
membrane dystrophy. While COD demonstrates potential for diagnostic purposes, 
additional studies are necessary to ascertain its specificity and distinguish 
EBMD from other ocular surface disorders.

BACKGROUND: Primary malignant chest wall tumors, originating from the bones, are 
infrequent neoplasms. Given its heterogeneity, further research is needed to 
understand the implications of recurrence and related factors in patients 
undergoing chest wall resection.
AIMS: We analyzed the association between the clinicopathological 
characteristics of these patients and their overall-survival (OS) and 
disease-free-survival (DFS).
METHODS:  In this study, we conducted a retrospective analysis on patients who 
underwent chest wall resection for primary malignant bony chest wall tumors 
between 2000-2023.
RESULTS: Fifty-one patients were included. The presence of Ewing tumor, prior 
adjuvant therapy, postoperative complications, and reduced surgical margin were 
significantly associated with DFS and OS in both survival and univariate 
analyses. The optimal surgical margin threshold was identified as greater than 3 
cm. Multivariate analysis revealed that only histopathological diagnosis of 
Ewing tumor and an insufficient margin remained significant for worse DFS and OS 
(p = 0.041 and 0.024, respectively). The 5-year overall survival (OS) and 
disease-free survival (DFS) rates were 53.6% and 50.8%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Ensuring effective surgery of chest wall tumors necessitates a 
surgical margin greater than 3 cm. Furthermore, the histopathologic 
classification of Ewing carcinoma emerges as another determinant impacting DFS 
and OS.

Pyroptotic inflammation has been shown to contribute to neuronal injury after 
stroke. Uncoordinated-5 homolog B (UNC5B) is implicated in neuroinflammation, 
and its downstream kinase death-associated protein kinase 3 (DAPK3) is predicted 
to interact with mevalonate kinase (MVK). To examine the role of UNC5B in 
post-stroke pyroptosis, we used a photothrombosis (PT) stroke model in mice and 
an oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) model in BV-2 microglia. Knockdown of Unc5b 
or Mvk and pharmacological inhibition of DAPK3 were performed, followed by 
detection of pyroptosis-associated proteins and cell viability. Interactions 
between DAPK3 and MVK were assessed using transwell coculture and 
co-immunoprecipitation. PT or OGD induced neuronal injury and increased 
expression of pyroptosis-related proteins. Knockdown of Unc5b or Mvk in 
microglia protected neurons by suppressing pyroptosis and disrupting the 
DAPK3-MVK protein complex. Upregulation of p-MVK was prevented by either Unc5b 
knockdown or DAPK3 inhibition, whereas DAPK3 upregulation was blocked only by 
Unc5b knockdown and not by Mvk knockdown. Our results suggest that UNC5B 
promotes post-stroke microglial pyroptosis in part through the DAPK3/MVK 
pathway.

PURPOSE: The septal pouch is an anatomical variant resulting from incomplete 
fusion between the septum primum and the septum secundum at the interatrial 
septum. This partial fusion creates a conical pouch, which is potentially 
predisposed to thrombus formation, increasing the degree of thromboembolic risk. 
This cadaveric study aimed to evaluate the prevalence, morphology, and 
morphometry of septal pouches and their associations with other septal defects.
METHODOLOGY: The interatrial septa of 60 human hearts were examined for septal 
pouches. Characteristics such as pouch type, apex and base orientation, base 
width, depth, and morphological variants were documented.
RESULTS: Atrial septal pouches (ASPs) were identified in 22/60 (37%) specimens. 
Right atrial septal pouches (RSPs) were predominant (30%), whereas left atrial 
septal pouches (LSPs) were found in 7% of the patients. Most RSPs exhibited a 
thin, membranous, flattened morphology, although some were thick and muscular. 
All LSPs were thin and flattened, with a superiorly directed ostium and an 
inferiorly directed apex. Histologically, the pouches demonstrated a trilaminar 
arrangement, comprising the myocardium sandwiched between two endocardial 
layers, with collagen-rich connective tissue beneath.
CONCLUSION: This study highlights important anatomical insights regarding septal 
pouches, emphasizing the higher prevalence and varied morphometry of RSPs. Given 
their potential clinical significance in thromboembolic phenomena, further 
investigation into septal pouch involvement in cardiovascular diseases is 
warranted.

BACKGROUND: Nocturia is a common and burdensome symptom that may reflect 
underlying cardiovascular dysfunction. While previous studies have linked 
nocturia to heart failure and fluid overload, direct hemodynamic evidence 
supporting this association remains limited.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relationship between left- and right-sided filling 
pressures, particularly pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP) and right atrial 
(RA) pressure, and nocturia severity in a cohort of patients undergoing right 
heart catheterization.
METHODS: We conducted a prospective observational study of 74 adult patients 
undergoing right heart catheterization with documented PAWP. Nocturia frequency 
was assessed via structured interview and modeled as an ordinal outcome. 
Spearman's correlation and ordinal logistic regression were used to examine 
associations between PAWP and nocturia severity. Additional analyses explored 
relationships with right-sided filling pressures (right atrial, right 
ventricular end-diastolic (RVEDP), and pulmonary artery (PA) pressures). Because 
of multicollinearity, we fit separate adjusted ordinal logistic models including 
one pressure variable at a time (PAWP, RA, PA and RVEDP), each adjusted for left 
ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), diuretic use, and peripheral edema (where 
available).
RESULTS: PAWP was significantly associated with nocturia severity (ρ = 0.35, 
p = 0.003). In adjusted ordinal logistic regression, each 1 mmHg increase in 
PAWP was associated with a 7-10% higher odds of more frequent nighttime voiding. 
In separate multivariable models adjusted for LVEF, diuretic use, and peripheral 
edema both RA pressure (OR 1.15 per mmHg, p = 0.021) and RVEDP (OR 1.17 per 
mmHg, p = 0.002) were independently associated with greater nocturia severity, 
wereas PA pressure showed a trend (OR = 1.06 per mmHg, p = 0.078).
CONCLUSIONS: Both left- and right-sided ventricular filling pressures, 
particularly PAWP and RA pressure, are independently associated with nocturia 
severity in adjusted analyses. These findings support nocturia as a clinical 
marker of hemodynamic congestion, highlighting the importance of nocturia as a 
symptom of fluid overload and potential cardiac dysfunction.

Background The objective of this study was to ascertain whether cardiometabolic 
index(CMI), visceral adiposity index (VAI), dysfunctional adiposity index (DAI), 
and body adiposity index (BAI) are superior predictors of future hypertension 
risk when compared with conventional indicators such as waist circumference(WC), 
body mass index (BMI) and waist-to-height ratio(WHtR).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is a post hoc analysis of the MONICA protocol. We 
selected 597 patients based on inclusions criteria. Data collection began in 
1992, and follow-up was conducted on the same group of participants in 2007. The 
study collected anthropometric indexes and biochemical data.
RESULTS: After adjusting for confounding factors using multivariate Cox 
regression analysis, the following results were observed: CMI [HR: 1.754 
(1.240-2.480); P = 0.001], VAI [HR: 1.533 (1.074-2.187); P = 0.018], DAI [HR: 
1.382 (0.982-1.945); P = 0.064], BAI [HR: 2.791 (1.790-4.352); P < 0.001], WC 
[HR: 2.234 (1.510-3.307); P < 0.001], WHtR [HR: 2.303 (1.589-3.339); P < 0.001], 
and BMI [HR: 2.488 (1.778-3.561); P < 0.001] were all significantly associated 
with the incidence of hypertension. ROC curve analysis showed that the area 
under the curve (AUC) for WC product was the highest (0.649, 95% CI: 
0.605-0.693), followed by BMI (0.648, 95% CI: 0.603-0.692), WHtR (0.646, 95% CI: 
0.601-0.690), and then by CMI (0.603, 95% CI: 0.557-0.649).
CONCLUSIONS: Although the CMI, VAI, DAI and BAI can all be utilised as 
independent predictors of hypertension, the predictive discriminatory power of 
these novel indicators for hypertension remains inferior to that of traditional 
indicators such as WC, BMI and WHtR.

Advanced lung disease, cardiovascular disease (CVD), infections, malignancies, 
and thromboembolic disease (TED) determine the mortality of patients with 
sarcoidosis. Our objective was to evaluate the main causes of admission and 
in-hospital mortality in patients with sarcoidosis in Spain. A retrospective and 
observational analysis of the National Registry of Hospital Discharges 
(RAE-CMBD) of patients admitted with a diagnosis of sarcoidosis between 2016 and 
2021 was performed. A total of 18,887 admissions of patients with sarcoidosis 
were identified. The main causes of admission were infection (21%), sarcoidosis 
itself (16.4%), CVD (12.7%), and malignancies (7.1%). Overall, 892 (4.7%) 
patients died, mainly from infection (32.1%), CVD (16.3%) and neoplasms (12.4%), 
with case fatality rates of 7.2%, 6% and 8.3%, respectively. Factors associated 
with higher in-hospital mortality were Charlson comorbidity index (OR 1.30 95%CI 
1.27-1.34), sarcoidosis pulmonary involvement (OR = 1.20, 95%CI 1.04-1.38), 
pulmonary fibrosis (OR 2.07; 95%CI 1.52-2.81) and CVD (OR 1.56; 95%CI 
1.26-1.95), infection (OR 2.37; 95%CI 1.97-2.84), malignancies (OR 1.77; 95%CI 
1.38-2.27) and TE-related admissions (OR 2.1, 95%CI 1.21-3.76). The main 
determinants of hospital admissions and mortality in patients with sarcoidosis 
are infections, CVD, neoplasm, VTE, pulmonary fibrosis, and a high comorbidity 
burden. While sarcoidosis itself is a common cause of admission, it is rarely 
the cause of death. Prevention of infections, VTE, and neoplasm, along with 
control of cardiovascular risk factors, may help reduce mortality in these 
patients.

A hormonal disorder that severely affects women's routine physical and emotional 
life is PCOS (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome). It has been witnessed as a heavily 
detrimental and most threatening disorder, causing multiple complications, such 
as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and endometrial carcinoma. One of 
the major causes of PCOS is hyperandrogenism, which results in the dysfunction 
of the ovaries. The enzyme responsible for such excessive production of androgen 
is 3-beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-1 (3βHSD1), which is an oxidoreductase 
that performs multiple functions in steroid metabolism. Trilostane and 
troglitazone are proposed inhibitors for 3βHSD1 with anticipated side effects. 
With the aim to identify non-steroidal phytocompounds, structure-based ligand 
screening against ChEBI was done, which resulted in 3459 compounds. Initially, 
NAD was docked into the protein to have an active enzyme structure. Then other 
ligands were docked. Based on a docking score of - 8.0 kcal/mol, ADME 
properties, and interaction profiling, seven compounds-Aphidicolin, Sagequinone 
methide A, Premarrubiin, Hoda acetal, Ophiopogonanone A, Brosimacutin C, and 
Cremastranone-were listed out. All these seven compounds were reported with 
medicinal importance in the literature. Hence, the stability of protein-ligand 
complexes was analyzed in detail through 200 ns MD simulation. Results from this 
study establish these compounds as leads for drug development to combat PCOS.

Type 1 hybrid arch repair - a simplified strategy for complex aortic arch 
pathologies.

Sarkar P, Adhikari S, Varma HG, Kumaar R, Maheshwary R, Gayen R, Kapoor L.

We report a case of a large distal arch and proximal descending thoracic aortic 
saccular aneurysm managed successfully with type I hybrid arch repair (off-pump 
debranching + thoracic endovascular aortic repair). Conventional open total arch 
replacement involves significant peri-operative risks, especially in elderly or 
comorbid patients, due to the need for cardiopulmonary bypass, circulatory 
arrest and cerebral protection. The hybrid arch repair technique combines open 
debranching of supra-aortic vessels with endovascular stent grafting to exclude 
the aneurysmal segment. This method avoids circulatory arrest, reduces operative 
time and minimizes complications, while maintaining the durability of open 
repair. It is particularly suitable for aneurysms of the distal arch and 
proximal descending thoracic aorta, with an adequate ascending aortic landing 
zone for endograft deployment.

BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of death globally, 
especially in the aging population. As a novel biomarker integrating 
inflammation and metabolic dysregulation, the C-reactive protein-triglyceride 
glucose index (CTI) may offer superior risk stratification, but its prognostic 
value for mortality in the elderly remains unclear.
METHODS: This multi-cohort retrospective study analyzed data from the NHANES 
(1999-2010), the CHARLS, and the regional Gaoyou datasets, focusing on 
participants aged ≥ 60 years. Associations between CTI quartiles and 
all-cause/cardiovascular mortality were assessed using Cox proportional hazards 
models, Kaplan-Meier curves, and restricted cubic splines. The predictive 
performance of CTI was compared with other metabolic indices (TyG, TyG-WC, etc.) 
using time-dependent ROC curves and net reclassification improvement (NRI).
RESULTS: Among 11,619 elderly participants, higher CTI levels were significantly 
associated with increased risks of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality across 
all three cohorts after full adjustment. A J-shaped nonlinear relationship was 
identified with an inflection point at CTI = 8.31, and subgroup analyses 
confirmed consistency across most strata. CTI demonstrated superior predictive 
performance for mortality (AUCs: 0.8445 for all-cause mortality and 0.8208 for 
cardiovascular mortality) and significantly improved risk reclassification 
(NRI > 0, p < 0.05) compared with other indices. The effectiveness of the 
prediction models was respectively verified in different Chinese databases. 
Sensitivity analyses on dynamic changes indicated that elevated trajectory of 
CTI represented higher mortality.
CONCLUSION: Elevated CTI is a robust and independent predictor of all-cause and 
cardiovascular mortality in the elderly populations of both the USA and China. 
Its integration into clinical practice could enhance early risk stratification 
and guide targeted interventions to mitigate mortality risk in aging adults.

BACKGROUND: The aims of this study were to evaluate the timing and trend of 
venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis initiation following surgical 
intervention, and the impact of VTE prophylaxis timing on the occurrence of VTE 
complications, across North American trauma centers in patients with complete 
traumatic cervical spinal cord injury (SCI).
METHODS: This retrospective, observational cohort study utilized data from the 
American College of Surgeons (ACS) Trauma Quality Improvement Program (TQIP) 
from 2013 to 2020. We identified surgically treated patients with complete 
traumatic cervical SCI. Patient variables included age, sex, race, insurance 
coverage, and comorbidity status. Outcomes of interest included time to VTE 
prophylaxis following surgery and the occurrence of VTE complications. 
Mixed-effect regression models were constructed to evaluate the adjusted 
estimate for each outcome accounting for patient-, injury-, and hospital-level 
covariates.
RESULTS: The study included 5,325 patients treated across 463 trauma centers. 
The mean age in the cohort was 46.7 ± 18.9 years, with male predominance 
(81.1%). Race was predominantly White (62.3%) and Black (23.0%). The mean time 
to VTE prophylaxis initiation was 90 ± 112 hours, and the median time was 65 
hours (interquartile range, 39 to 105 hours). The annual trend of VTE 
prophylaxis initiation after surgery was a decrease by 5.2 hours per year over 
the 8-year study interval. This was associated with an annual reduction of 6.2% 
in the odds of VTE complication occurrence. Multivariable mixed-effect 
regression models demonstrated a significant reduction in time to VTE 
prophylaxis (mean difference, -3.7 hours per year [95% confidence interval [CI], 
-5.3 to -2.1 hours per year]; p < 0.001) and VTE complications (odds ratio, 0.93 
per year [95% CI, 0.88 to 0.98 per year]; p = 0.01) over the study period, after 
adjustment.
CONCLUSIONS: This analysis provides insight into VTE prophylaxis practice 
patterns following surgery for complete cervical SCI across North American 
trauma centers from 2013 to 2020. The timing of VTE prophylaxis initiation 
consistently decreased, which appeared to be associated with a significant 
reduction found in VTE complications.

BACKGROUND: Astrocytes are an essential glial cell which express GFAP, a marker 
of astrocytic activation and structural integrity. A recent study by our group 
links serum GFAP levels to tau pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD), suggesting 
its value as a diagnostic biomarker. Our aim is to examine the GFAP levels in 
serum (GFAPs) in correlation with various neuropathological variables, 
specifically focusing on the medial temporal lobe (MTL).
METHOD: In 156 brains from the VARS dementia cohort, we analyzed a set of 
neuropathological variables including macroscopic data and classification and 
staging criteria for AD, Lewy Body Pathology (LBP), Cerebrovascular Disease 
(VD), Hippocampal sclerosis (HS), and TDP-43 pathology (LATE).
RESULT: First, we observed a correlation between GFAPs and tissue GFAP 
immunostaining in the entorhinal cortex (r=0.211, p <0.05). Then, we found a 
correlation of GFAPs with brain weight (r=-0.366, p <0.001), NIA A (r=0.262, 
p <0.01), NIA B (r=0.416, p <0.001), NIA C (r=0.256, p <0.01), LPC 
classification (r=0.218; p <0.01), and with the presence of more combined 
pathologies with high burden (r=0.28, p <0.001). Besides, we observed a trend of 
increasing GFAPs values with higher stages of MTL atrophy, Braak tau, HS, and 
LATE. However, no significant correlation was detected between GFAPs and VD. 
Finally, a lineal regression model showed that NIA B (p <0.001), HS (head of the 
hippocampus) (p <0.05), and Braak α-syn stages (p <0.05) were the best 
predictors for GFAPs.
CONCLUSION: Our study shows that GFAP in serum correlates with neuropathological 
variables, specially with tissue tau pathology, supporting the potential of GFAP

Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide, primarily due 
to ischemic events caused by thrombus formation, such as ischemic heart disease 
and stroke. Current treatments face significant limitations: mechanical 
thrombectomy lacks accessibility, while fibrinolytic drugs cause severe adverse 
effects and show limited efficacy. Local hyperthermia may offer a broader 
mechanism of action, targeting not only the fibrin scaffold but also other clot 
components. In this work, we present a fully drug-free strategy based on hybrid 
microparticles (HPs) composed of magnetite nanoparticles (MNPs) assembled within 
cross-linked dextran microgels, for magnetically targeted photo-thermal therapy. 
HPs are synthesized through inverse emulsion cross-linking using biocompatible 
materials. They exhibit micrometer injectable size, low dispersity, high 
colloidal stability and excellent biocompatibility. Magnetic coupling of ≈105 
MNPs within each HP generates a strong magnetic macromoment (≈10- 1 1 emu), 
enabling efficient magnetic targeting, both in vitro and in vivo. This feature 
is accompanied by high photo-thermal conversion efficiency (38%). The 
determination of a thrombolytic temperature window enables in vitro 
photo-thermal thrombolysis, while in vivo application on a murine thrombus model 
leads to significant photo-thermal clot reduction (-32%), without any 
pharmaceutical agent. These findings highlight the potential of magnetically 
coupled magnetite nanoparticles for drug-free targeted photo-thermal 
thrombolysis.

BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF) have been strongly implicated in 
elevating the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD), highlighting the 
intricate relationship between cardiovascular health and neurodegeneration. In 
this context, ADAM10 emerges as a promising blood-based biomarker for AD, given 
its well-established association with amyloid deposition and its potential to 
provide insights into the link between cardiovascular health and amyloid 
pathology. This study explores the potential relationship between CVRF and 
plasma ADAM10 levels in cognitively healthy older adults.
METHOD: In this cross-sectional analysis, the cognitive function was assessed 
using the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination-Revised (ACE-R). The Framingham 
Score determined the cardiovascular risk profile. ADAM10 plasma levels were 
measured using Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Group comparisons 
were conducted using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test for continuous variables and 
the Chi-square test for categorical variables. Linear regression models were 
employed to investigate associations with cognitive outcomes.
RESULT: The study included 84 adults aged 60 and older, from whom 52 
participants (96.2% females) were assigned to the low cardiovascular risk group, 
whereas 33 participants (15.2% females) were classified as medium/high 
cardiovascular risk. Despite the robust strength of the association between 
ADAM10 plasma levels and cognitive scores in non-adjusted analyses (β = 0.162, 
95% CI [0.008, 0.316], P = .040), this association did not remain statistically 
significant in the mutually adjusted model (β = 0.077, 95% CI [-0.048, 0.202], 
P = .226). As expected, multivariate analyses revealed that older age 
(β = -0.465, 95% CI [-0.767, -0.162], P = .003) was significantly associated 
with worse cognitive performance. Conversely, higher levels of formal education 
(β = 0.774, 95% CI [0.510, 1.038], P < .001) were associated with better 
cognition.
CONCLUSION: No evidence of a robust association between ADAM10 levels and CVRF 
was found. The lack of a significant association may be attributed to the 
insufficient number of participants classified as having high CVR. Larger 
samples are needed to enable more detailed analyses with optimal group 
stratification. We speculate that the inclusion of participants with higher 
levels of formal education may have contributed to this non-significant result, 
given the association between higher education and preventive health care.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify profiles of social participation among 
stroke survivors with limb dysfunction and explore the factors influencing these 
profiles.
DESIGN: A convergent mixed-methods design.
METHODS: The quantitative phase involved 499 participants recruited from 5 
neurorehabilitation centres in Shanghai between December 2023 and June 2025. 
Participants completed measures including the Utrecht Scale for Evaluation of 
Rehabilitation-Participation (USER-P), the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale 
(CD-RISC-10), and the Modified Rankin Scale (mRS). Qualitative semi-structured 
interviews were performed with 16 participants to explore lived experiences of 
social participation.
RESULTS: Latent profile analysis revealed 4 distinct social participation 
profiles: "Active Integration", "Contented Conservatism", "Cautious 
Conservatism", and "Alienated Disengagement". A multivariate analysis identified 
age, resilience, and physical function as significant predictors of profile 
membership. Qualitative findings uncovered 2 core emotional experiences (a sense 
of loss vs a sense of rebuilding) and 3 behavioural patterns (activist, 
conservative, alienated), which effectively explained the quantitative profiles' 
characteristics and their underlying mechanisms. The integration of data 
provided a nuanced person-centred framework depicting the heterogeneity in 
post-stroke social participation.
CONCLUSION: Social participation among stroke survivors is heterogeneous and can 
be classified into 4 distinct profiles shaped by the interplay of physical 
function, resilience, and sociodemographic factors. The findings underscore the 
necessity of implementing profile-specific, stepped-care interventions for 
effectively enhancing post-stroke social participation.

OBJECTIVE: This longitudinal study evaluated acute-phase stroke patients, 
examining changes in skeletal muscle quantity and quality. The research aimed to 
determine when muscle quality deteriorates, its relationship with muscle 
quantity, and contributing factors.
DESIGN: Prospective observational study.
PATIENTS: Forty stroke patients.
METHODS: Muscle quantity was assessed as the thickness of the anterior and 
lateral mid-thigh, while muscle quality was assessed by echo intensity of the 
rectus femoris and vastus lateralis. Measurements on paretic and non-paretic 
limbs were taken on the first day after stroke onset and on the 10th day.
RESULTS: Muscle thickness of all regions of paretic and non-paretic limbs 
significantly decreased at 10 days, whereas echo intensity significantly 
increased only in the paretic limb. A significant negative correlation between 
changes in muscle thickness and echo intensity was observed in the paretic limb 
only. Multiple regression analysis revealed that the only variable that explains 
the changes in echo intensity was the changes in muscle thickness of the paretic 
limb.
CONCLUSION: Muscle quality begins to deteriorate as early as the acute phase of 
stroke. To prevent this deterioration, it is important to encourage skeletal 
muscle activity during the acute phase of immobilization and to minimise the 
reduction in muscle quantity.

PURPOSE: To explore sex-specific differences in cardiac rehabilitation (CR) 
outcomes.
METHODS: Aerobic capacity (6-Minute Walk Test), physical behaviour 
(accelerometer), cardiovascular risk profile (weight, blood pressure, 
cholesterol), and psychosocial well-being (questionnaires) were measured in 
patients after an acute coronary syndrome (147 women, 642 men) at CR start and 
completion, and 18 months' follow-up. Sex differences were studied using GEE 
models adjusted for age and differences in baseline characteristics. 
Additionally, whether men and women met targets associated with health risk 
reductions was assessed.
RESULTS: Both sexes experienced similar CR benefits. Only for depressive 
symptoms did women show larger improvements (HADS score; ♀: -2.7 vs ♂: -1.1; 
p = 0.017). Nevertheless, long-term follow-up revealed women still lagged in 
meeting targets for physical activity (♀: 76.5% vs ♂: 93.1%; p < 0.001) and 
anxiety symptoms (♀: 75.5% vs ♂: 86.8%; p < 0.001), while men lagged in meeting 
aerobic capacity targets (♀: 71.3% vs ♂: 58.8%; p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Women experience similar CR benefits to men in aerobic capacity, 
physical behaviour, cardiovascular risk profile, anxiety, and quality of life, 
with greater improvement in depressive symptoms. However, target values were 
less often met by women in physical behaviour and psychosocial well-being, and 
by men in aerobic capacity. Tailored CR programmes may be needed to address the 
unique needs of women and men.

Preeclampsia (PE) is a pregnancy-related disorder characterized by impaired 
migration and invasion of trophoblast cells. Recent studies have highlighted the 
critical role of autophagy in the development of PE. However, the precise 
mechanisms underlying the upregulation of autophagy in PE remain unclear. This 
study demonstrated that the expression of the tumor suppressor p53-binding 
protein 2 (TP53BP2) is significantly upregulated in patients with PE. Silencing 
of TP53BP2 not only decreases autophagy but also attenuates PE progression in 
rat model. Moreover, TP53BP2 expression was positively correlated with blood 
pressure and body mass index (BMI) but negatively correlated with gestational 
age at delivery and neonatal birth weight. Our findings suggest that TP53BP2 
enhances autophagy by promoting the release of Beclin-1 from the Bcl-2/Beclin-1 
complex. Additionally, DNMT1 and G9a cooperatively downregulated TP53BP2 
expression by reducing DNA methylation and H3K9me2 enrichment in the TP53BP2 
promoter region. Importantly, the cooperation between DNMT1 and G9a suppressed 
E2F1 binding to the TP53BP2 promoter, leading to transcriptional repression of 
TP53BP2 in trophoblasts. In brief, our study indicates that TP53BP2 promotes 
autophagy in trophoblasts through DNA methylation and H3K9me2-mediated 
transcriptional regulation. These findings suggest that targeting TP53BP2 may be 
a potential therapeutic strategy for PE.

BACKGROUND: Depressive symptoms are a modifiable risk factor for dementia, yet 
underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Depression is a heterogeneous condition, 
encompassing a wide range of symptoms, and it may be valuable to identify 
specific symptom patterns that are most associated with an increased risk of 
cognitive impairment and blood-based biomarkers. Here, we investigated the 
associations between Visit 1 depressive symptoms and plasma 
Amyloid-Tau-Neurodegeneration-Inflammation or ATN(I) biomarkers 7-years later in 
a diverse cohort of middle-aged and older Hispanic/Latino individuals, a 
population often underrepresented in dementia research.
METHOD: Participants recruited into the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of 
Latinos (HCHS/SOL; Visit 1 conducted between 2008-2011) and its ancillary study, 
Study of Latinos-Investigation of Neurocognitive Aging (SOL-INCA; Visit 2 
conducted between 2015-2018) were screened for somatic, negative affective, and 
anhedonia symptoms of depression at Visit 1 (Center for Epidemiological 
Studies-Depression Scale, CESD-10). Plasma ATN(I) biomarkers included 
beta-amyloid 42/40 (Aβ42/40 ratio, n = 5,536), phosphorylated tau181 (p-tau181, 
n = 5,713), neurofilament light chain (NfL, n = 5,866), and glial fibrillary 
acidic protein (GFAP, n = 5,686) measured at Visit 2 7-years later (Quanterix 
Simoa HD-X Analyzer). Survey-based generalized linear regressions measured 
associations between continuous depressive symptoms (somatic, negative 
affective, and anhedonia subscales, respectively) and plasma ATN(I) biomarkers 
7-years later, adjusting for age, sex, Hispanic/Latino heritage, body mass 
index, APOE status, education, diabetes, cardiovascular disease risk factors 
(smoking, dyslipidemia, hypertension), antidepressant use, and field center.
RESULT: Higher somatic symptoms at Visit 1 were associated with higher ptau-181 
(β= 0.03, 95% CI [-0.05; 0.12]), higher NfL (β= 1.30, CI [-0.52;3.12]), and 
lower GFAP (β= -2.95, CI [-8.36;2.46]) 7-years later, albeit not significantly. 
Higher anhedonia and negative affective symptoms were associated with lower 
ptau-181 (β= -0.05, CI [-0.11;0.01] and β= -0.05, CI [-0.11;0.02], 
respectively), higher NfL (β= 0.02, CI [-0.79;0.83] and β=0.45, CI [-0.78; 1.69] 
respectively), and lower GFAP (β= -2.71, CI [-6.30;0.88] and β= - 2.37, CI 
[-6.49;1.74]).
CONCLUSION: The current work suggests that different depressive symptoms may 
uniquely relate to distinct ATN(I) biomarkers. Future studies will examine the 
potential impact of chronic depressive symptoms as this longitudinal cohort ages 
as well as neurocognitive outcomes, providing a deeper understanding of the 
pathways linking depression to cognitive decline.

BACKGROUND: Right ventricular-pulmonary arterial (RV-PA) uncoupling is central 
to prognosis in precapillary pulmonary hypertension (PH). While the tricuspid 
annular plane systolic excursion tosystolic pulmonary artery pressure 
(TAPSE/sPAP) ratio is an established bedside surrogate of RV-PA coupling, novel 
energetic markers such as three-dimensional (3D)-derived right ventricular (RV) 
global wasted work (GWW) may provide complementary insight into maladaptive RV 
remodeling.
OBJECTIVES: To contextualize the prognostic value of RV GWW relative to 
TAPSE/sPAP and clarify their mechanistic and clinical complementarity.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients with elevated GWW (≥38 mmHg/%) exhibited evidence 
of RV-PA uncoupling, including a reduced RV end-systolic elastance to arterial 
elastance (Ees/Ea) ratio (0.47 [0.34-0.73] vs. 0.71 [0.50-0.91]; p = 0.007) and 
lower TAPSE/sPAP ratio (0.21 [0.18-0.32] vs. 0.34 [0.22- 0.45] mm/Hg; p = 0.003) 
compared with lower GWW. In secondary analyses, a TAPSE/sPAP ratio below the 
median was associated with increased risk of death or lung transplantation 
(hazard ratio [HR] 3.20; 95% CI: 1.45-7.08), remaining significant after 
adjustment for age and sex (adjusted HR 2.97; 95% CI: 1.27-6.94). Discrimination 
was modest and comparable for TAPSE/sPAP (C-statistic 0.63; 95% CI: 0.53-0.73) 
and GWW (C-statistic 0.61), with no significant difference between metrics (ΔC = 
-0.02; p = 0.68).
CONCLUSIONS: TAPSE/sPAP remains a robust and clinically valuable surrogate of 
macroscopic RV-PA coupling. However, GWW offers complementary information by 
quantifying myocardial inefficiency related to paradoxical and postsystolic 
deformation, capturing energetic consequences of afterload mismatch that may not 
be reflected by displacement-based indices alone. Integrating energetic and 
mechanical markers may enable a more granular assessment of RV performance, 
particularly in intermediate-risk PH, and warrants evaluation in larger 
multicenter studies.

BACKGROUND: People living with HIV (PLHIV) are at increased risk of 
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), but the immunological mechanisms 
driving plaque formation remain unclear. This study investigated the association 
between peripheral immune cell subsets and carotid atherosclerotic plaques in 
PLHIV without prior clinical ASCVD.
METHODS: In this multi-center cross-sectional study, virally suppressed PLHIV 
receiving antiretroviral therapy were enrolled from two Dutch cohorts: a 
discovery cohort (n= 994) and a validation cohort (n= 200). Between November 
2019 and October 2021, participants underwent carotid ultrasound imaging to 
assess plaques using standardized criteria. Immune profiling was performed using 
high-dimensional flow cytometry of 355 immune cell populations. Associations 
with plaque were analyzed using linear regression adjusted for relevant 
confounders, and key findings were validated in the second cohort. 
Transcriptomic profiles of main cell populations were evaluated using 
deconvoluted bulk RNA sequencing to identify differential expression and pathway 
enrichment.
RESULTS: Carotid plaques were present in 584 participants (49%) - 502 of 994 
(51%) in the discovery and 82 of 200 (41%) in the validation cohort. Plaques 
were associated with higher counts of several CD8+ T cell subsets, particularly 
PD-1-expressing cytotoxic T cells with an interferon secretion profile 
(CD8TC1PD1+). Transcriptomic analysis of CD8+ T cells revealed downregulated 
mitochondrial function and upregulated type 1 interferon and epidermal growth 
factor receptor (EGFR) signaling, indicating a senescent phenotype.
CONCLUSIONS: CD8+ T cell senescence may contribute to early atherosclerotic 
plaque formation in PLHIV. Targeting immune senescence could offer a novel 
strategy for cardiovascular risk reduction in this population.

Cardiovascular risk factors contribute to the majority of dementia cases, with 
about 20% directly attributable to vascular cognitive impairment and dementia 
(VCID). VCID treatment developments have been slow compared with Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), which now has several FDA-approved symptom- and disease-modifying 
agents. In the second part of this JACC Seminar Series, advances and new 
perspectives on the management and prevention of VCID are reviewed. There is 
reasonable evidence that cognitive enhancers (donepezil, galantamine, and 
memantine) modestly improve cognition in vascular dementia (VaD), the most 
severe form of VCID, especially if there is associated AD pathology. 
Antidepressants may benefit those with depression and stroke, but they have poor 
efficacy in those with depression and VaD alone. Behavioral, social, and 
environmental interventions are first-line therapies for managing 
VCID-associated agitation and psychosis. Second-line antipsychotics have not 
been trialed in those with VaD alone, but are beneficial where AD and VaD 
co-exist, with risperidone and quetiapine effective in reducing psychosis and 
agitation. Primary prevention of VCID includes identifying and managing 
cardiometabolic risk factors along with manifestations of covert cerebrovascular 
disease. Both primary and secondary VCID prevention involve management of 
cardiovascular risks, specifically hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking, 
atrial fibrillation, obesity, and sedentariness. Management of vascular risk 
factors may moderately reduce the risk of incident cognitive impairment. Novel 
interventions currently being evaluated in clinical trials are discussed. The 
discovery and utilization of VCID and AD biomarkers will enhance the specificity 
and effectiveness of interventions such that a precision-medicine approach to 
disease-specific medical therapy may be taken.

Vascular cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID), ie, cognitive impairment 
secondary to cerebrovascular disease (CeVD), is the second most common form of 
dementia after Alzheimer's disease (AD), accounting for 15% to 20% of all cases. 
CeVD, in fact, contributes to dementia alongside other neuropathologies in up to 
75% of dementia cases. CeVD and AD not only frequently co-occur in the brain, 
but they may also interact, and some VCID risk factors (midlife hypertension and 
diabetes) also increase AD risk. Because CeVD and cardiovascular disease share 
risk factors and pathophysiology, the cardiovascular clinician is likely to 
encounter both in the clinic. Moreover, common cardiac disorders, such as atrial 
fibrillation, heart failure, acute coronary syndrome, and valvular disease, 
increase VCID risk. There have been recent developments in the diagnostic 
criteria for VCID, with advances in risk biomarkers, treatment, and prevention 
of cognitive impairment and dementia. The diagnosis of VCID is a 2-step process, 
with the initial identification of a cognitive syndrome followed by the 
establishment of a predominantly vascular etiology, guided by clinical history 
and examination and substantiated by neuroimaging, preferably magnetic resonance 
imaging. Clinical presentations include an acute onset, a stepwise decline, a 
fluctuating course if caused by multiple strokes, or a gradual slow progression 
if attributable to cerebral small vessel disease. Cognitive deficits can be 
found in several domains, such as information-processing speed, attention, 
executive function, and emotional lability, sometimes referred to as the 
subcortical syndrome, often seen in the early stages of VCID without cortical 
infarcts. The diagnosis is supported by the identification of large and small 
infarcts, lacunes, white matter hyperintensities, dilated perivascular spaces 
and cerebral microbleeds using magnetic resonance imaging. This part 1 of a 
2-part JACC review series describes the clinical features, pathophysiology, and 
biomarkers of VCID for cardiovascular clinicians who have a critical role in its 
early identification, management, and prevention in their patients.

BACKGROUND: Loss of the Y chromosome (LOY) from a percentage of circulating 
leukocytes is common in older men and is associated with cardiovascular risk. 
However, most studies have involved men with preexisting disease, not healthy 
men followed prospectively.
OBJECTIVES: This study sought to investigate the association between LOY and 
risk of incident major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), including 
myocardial infarction (MI) and ischemic stroke.
METHODS: This study included 5,131 men aged ≥ 65 years from the ASPREE (ASPirin 
in Reducing Events in the Elderly) trial with no prior cardiovascular disease at 
baseline. LOY percentage was measured in peripheral blood using microarrays and 
the log-R-ratio method. MACEs, including MI and ischemic stroke, were collected 
during the trial and subsequent observational follow-up. Cox regression assessed 
associations of LOY as a continuous (per SD) and categorical (decile-based) 
variable. Deciles 1 through 6 (reference) represented no LOY, deciles 7 through 
9 moderate, and decile 10 substantial.
RESULTS: Over a median of 8.4 years of follow-up, 9.8% men (n = 505) experienced 
MACEs, with 5% (n = 256) MI and 4% (n = 207) ischemic stroke. In the fully 
adjusted model, each SD increase in LOY was associated with 14% higher MI risk 
(HR per SD: 1.14; 95% CI: 1.02-1.28). Men with substantial LOY (decile 10) had 
68% higher MI risk vs men without LOY (HR: 1.68; 95% CI: 1.16-2.54). No 
associations were observed for ischemic stroke. Results were robust to 
sensitivity analyses. In 191,340 men aged 40 to 70 years from the UK Biobank, 
LOY was also associated with MI (HR per SD: 1.03; 95% CI: 1.01-1.06).
CONCLUSIONS: LOY is associated with increased MI risk, but not stroke, in older 
men.

Hepatic echinococcosis (HE), a major zoonotic disease, remains endemic in 
pastoral regions of Western China, where its incidence is closely linked to 
geographical, livestock and sanitary conditions. The disease presents a 
significant clinical challenge due to the complexity of host-parasite 
interactions and a high recurrence rate. To date, the underlying pathogenesis 
and effective prevention and control strategies remain inadequately studied. 
Particularly, it is still unclear how innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) affect 
disease progression and therapeutic intervention. This review focuses on ILCs 
and their emerging role in the pathogenesis of HE. Through an in-depth analysis 
of the biological characteristics of ILCs, we revealed their significant role in 
immune responses and therapeutic mechanisms. Additionally, we also investigated 
their dynamic involvement in the development of HE. Furthermore, the specific 
role of gene editing in modulating ILC function was examined. Clinically, we 
assessed the distribution and functional status of ILCs in patients with HE and 
analysed their association with hepatic fibrosis and other complications. 
Finally, we explored novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies based on ILC 
functional modulation. In short, this review highlights the critical role of 
ILCs in shaping the immunological landscape of HE, offering a theoretical basis 
for the development of ILC-targeted diagnosis and treatment of the disease. 
Through ILC functional modulation, the intervention of fibrotic progression and 
immune imbalance holds promise for overcoming current therapeutic limitations 
and advancing clinical translation.

BACKGROUND: Cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) is the most common cause of 
vascular cognitive impairment, but its relationship to cognition across the 
neurocognitive spectrum is not fully understood. CSVD burden can be inferred 
from several magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) markers, which can be combined to 
generate a CSVD score. We investigated the association between CSVD score with 
various cognitive measures.
METHOD: Baseline data from 972 participants [Table 1] from the Comprehensive 
Assessment of Neurodegeneration and Dementia (COMPASS-ND) study were analyzed 
[11.9% cognitively unimpaired [CU], 14.7% subjective cognitive decline [SCD], 
36.4% mild cognitive impairment [MCI], 36.9% dementia). Brain MRI scans were 
visually rated for Standards for Reporting Vascular Changes on Neuroimaging 
(STRIVE)-based evidence of vascular brain injury (lacunes, microbleeds, white 
matter hyperintensities [WMH], cortical superficial siderosis [cSS], enlarged 
perivascular spaces [EPVS]). Three CSVD scores corresponding to global, cerebral 
amyloid angiopathy (CAA-CSVD)-specific, and hypertensive arteriopathy 
(HTNA-CSVD)-specific CSVD burden were generated [Table 2]. Cognitive measures 
included the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Clinical Dementia Rating sum 
of boxes (CDR-SB), and a composite neuropsychological battery test z-score. We 
modelled CSVD score (exposure) associations with five outcomes: Hachinski 
ischemic score (negative binomial regression), MoCA total score (linear 
regression), CDR-SB (median quantile regression), and neuropsychological battery 
composite z-score (linear regression), cognitive diagnosis (ordinal logistic 
regression). Covariates included age, sex, and education.
RESULT: Global, CAA- and HTNA-CSVD scores were all associated with greater 
Hachinski ischemic score, poorer MoCA score, higher CDR-SB, and poorer composite 
neuropsychological battery test z-score [Table 3]. Both global CSVD score 
(adjusted odds ratio [aOR]=1.14, 95%CI: [1.02, 1.26], p = .02) and HTNA-CSVD 
score (aOR=1.18, 95%CI: [1.04, 1.35], p = .01) were associated with higher odds 
of a more severe cognitive diagnosis compared to a less severe cognitive 
diagnosis (e.g., dementia vs MCI/SCD/CU), but not CAA-CSVD score (aOR=1.09, 
95%CI: [0.97, 1.24], p = .15).
CONCLUSION: Older adults with greater CSVD burden, as evidenced by multiple MRI 
markers, exhibit poorer cognition and functional performance across the 
neurocognitive continuum. Notably, these associations were observed not only for 
global CSVD but also for both CAA- and HTNA-specific CSVD scores, suggesting the 
importance of evaluating these specific pathologies when assessing 
cerebrovascular contributions to cognitive decline.

Administrative data, including electronic health record (EHR) and claims data, 
are increasingly used to generate real-world evidence for epidemiologic 
research. Unlike clinical trials, which assess baseline conditions at the 
initial visit, observational studies using these data must define an appropriate 
lookback period to identify baseline characteristics. However, no established 
guidelines exist on the optimal length of lookback periods by clinical outcome. 
We conducted a scoping review, with a lens on methodological studies, to assess 
the frequency and variability of lookback periods used in epidemiologic studies. 
We searched PubMed for studies that employed lookback periods using EHR, claims 
data, or international registries. Our search yielded 262 studies spanning a 
broad range of clinical outcomes. We found that lookback periods varied 
significantly, ranging from 12 hours to 39 years, depending on the clinical 
outcome. The most common clinical areas included pharmacology, cardiovascular 
disease, cancer, and healthcare utilization. Our review underscores the need for 
tailored lookback periods based on the clinical context and suggests that a 
one-size-fits-all approach may be inadequate. Future research should focus on 
the impact of lookback periods on less-studied outcomes. This review provides a 
resource for researchers to make informed decisions on the appropriate lookback 
periods in epidemiologic studies utilizing administrative data.

INTRODUCTION: Vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia are 
potentially modifiable. Early detection of reversible arterial injury may 
improve risk stratification and provide treatment monitoring. We hypothesized 
that carotid ultrasound grayscale median (GSM), a novel imaging biomarker of 
early arterial injury, would predict incident all-cause dementia in the 
Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA).
METHODS: The MESA enrolled adults free of atherosclerotic cardiovascular 
disease. Common carotid GSM was measured at baseline. Incident all-cause 
dementia events were identified by hospital and death records. Cox proportional 
hazards models with natural cubic splines investigated the association of 
baseline GSM and all-cause dementia.
RESULTS: The 1788 participants were a mean (SD) 63.1 (10.3) years old and 53% 
were women. Over a median 13.7 years, 157 all-cause dementia events occurred. In 
fully adjusted models, with additional adjustment for carotid intima-media 
thickness, lower (worse) GSM independently predicted incident all-cause dementia 
(hazard ratio, 1st to 3rd tertile, 1.45 [95% CI, 1.11-1.90], p = 0.021).
CONCLUSIONS: Lower GSM independently predicts all-cause dementia, beyond 
traditional arterial injury measures, suggesting it may serve as an early marker 
of dementia risk.

Rare vascular diseases are a diverse group of life-threatening conditions 
defined by their low prevalence but profound impact on patient morbidity and 
quality of life. Diagnosing these disorders remains a significant clinical 
challenge due to their genetic heterogeneity, overlapping phenotypes, and 
limited patient populations. As such, the development of robust and 
human-relevant disease models is critical for elucidating pathogenic mechanisms 
and guiding therapeutic discovery. The advent of human induced pluripotent stem 
cell (iPSC) technology has opened new avenues for modeling rare vascular 
diseases by enabling the generation of patient-specific vascular cell types, 
including endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and fibroblasts, and the 
creation of both two-dimensional cultures and three-dimensional vascular 
organoids. Together with genome editing and next-generation multiomics, these 
platforms represent new approach methodologies (NAMs) that allow for detailed 
investigation of disease biology, facilitate the correction of pathogenic 
mutations, and enable high-throughput drug screening in a personalized context. 
In this review, we highlight the advancements in iPSC-derived vascular modeling, 
discuss the integration of gene editing and multiomics technologies, and explore 
their transformative potential for uncovering mechanisms and developing 
precision therapies for rare vascular diseases.

BACKGROUND: Critical illness is a risk factor for carnitine deficiency. 
Carnitine deficiency may result in serious medical complications and poor 
clinical outcomes. This study aimed to identify the prevalence and potential 
predictors of carnitine deficiency.
METHODS: This was a descriptive cross-sectional study conducted in a convenience 
sample of 144 critically ill adults admitted to a surgical or cardiovascular 
intensive care unit at the University of Utah Hospital, with serum carnitine 
levels measured from January 1, 2022, to December 31, 2024. Binary and 
multivariable logistic regression models were constructed to explore potential 
predictors of carnitine deficiency, which was defined as a free serum carnitine 
level <36 µmol/L.
RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 56.5 years; 41.7% of the sample had 
carnitine deficiency. For each unit decrease in body mass index, the odds of 
developing carnitine deficiency increased by 5% compared with maintaining normal 
free carnitine status (odds ratio [OR], 0.95; 95% confidence interval [CI], 
0.9-0.99). Those prescribed continuous renal replacement therapy were 2.43 times 
more likely to develop carnitine deficiency than those not on continuous renal 
replacement therapy (OR, 2.43; 95% CI, 1.12-5.25).
CONCLUSION: A high proportion of our study population had carnitine deficiency. 
Continuous renal replacement therapy and a lower body mass index were 
significant predictors in the multivariable model. Female sex and a history of 
chronic kidney disease may warrant further exploration based on significance in 
the univariable analysis.

BACKGROUND: Diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) are a common and severe disease with 
vascular and/or neurological complications, affecting the patient's health and 
quality of life. Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) is a non-drug treatment method that has 
anti-inflammatory effects, reduces edema, increases neovascularization, 
increases the synthesis of collagen fibers, and accelerates the wound healing 
process. This study aims to evaluate the results of treating patients with 
diabetic foot ulcers with HBO.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A randomized controlled study was conducted. A total of 94 
patients was diagnosed with diabetic foot ulcers, and treated at the Institute 
of Maritime Medicine from January 2021 to December 2023. Study subjects were 
divided into 2 groups: the study group included 43 patients treated with HBO 
combined with intravenous antibiotics, wound care, and control of underlying 
disease; the reference group included 51 patients who were not treated with HBO, 
but were treated with intravenous antibiotics, wound care, and control of 
underlying disease.
RESULTS: The infection status and level of granulation tissue growth of the 
study group were better than the reference group (p < 0.001); the depth and 
diameter of the ulcer in the study group decreased compared to the reference 
group (p < 0.05). Treatment time and amputation rate in the study group were 
reduced in comparison with the reference group: 10.1 ± 4.6 days, 15.1 ± 7.8 days 
and 4.6%, 11.7%.
CONCLUSIONS: Hyperbaric oxygens a good method for treating diabetic foot ulcers, 
helps with anti-inflammation, stimulates the growth of granulation tissue, 
quickly heals ulcers, reduces treatment time, and reduces amputation rates.

BACKGROUND: Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) can be used as a therapeutic 
modality for conditions other than decompression diseases, including wound 
healing in gangrene, compromised grafts and flaps, crush injuries, thermal 
burns, and intracranial abscesses. Beginning more recently, HBOT has also been 
used as an alternative treatment strategy for respiratory conditions in patients 
with COVID-19. This study aimed to determine the use of HBOT in the healing 
processes of the above-listed conditions.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: For this descriptive retrospective study, the authors used 
the data of patients who received HBOT at Manado Regional Hospital in Indonesia 
from January 2017 to December 2020. Patients were identified retrospectively 
according to their ICD-10 codes.
RESULTS: Of the 128 patients who had received HBOT, 60 had received it for 
decompression sickness (46.87%), 29 for thermal burns (22.65%), 19 for diabetic 
ulcers (14.84%), six for crush injuries, six for skin grafts, six for pre- or 
post-amputation (4.68%), and two for gangrene (1.56%).
CONCLUSIONS: Used for decompression sickness in 46.87% of cases and for wound 
healing in 50.13% of cases, HBOT is not only for decompression sickness but can 
be used as a therapeutic modality for other conditions as well.
